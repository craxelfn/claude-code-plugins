# P0 — Pre-flight hygiene (do these first; small, high-leverage)

> Goal: stop the alpha from being misleading. None of these add features; they tell the truth about state.

## Theme: Misleading state

### `[x]` P0.1 — Stamp date on `CHANGELOG.md [0.1.0-alpha]` section
**Why**: Section currently reads `## [0.1.0-alpha] — TBD (Phase 1 gate, week 1)` even though TC1..TC10h-7 are all green. Reads as "incomplete" to a reader who doesn't know the project history.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: header shows actual date (e.g. `## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-05-05`); the "Planned" subsection is moved to a `### Achieved` since all bullets there were live-tested.

### `[x]` P0.2 — Remove or fulfill the dangling TODO in `commands/run.py:175`
**Why**: Docstring at `scripts/oracle_ai_data_platform_fusion_bundle/commands/run.py:175` says *"The bundle ships ``notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb`` (TODO)"*. That notebook does not exist. New users will look for it.
**Size**: XS (doc fix) or M (ship the notebook — see P1.5)
**Depends on**: nothing for the doc fix; on P1.5 for the real notebook
**Accept**: either (a) docstring rephrased to "Phase 2 will ship a notebook entry point", or (b) `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb` exists and the TODO is removed.

### `[~]` ~~P0.3 — Decide `STATUS.md` + `BACKLOG.md` git fate~~ — **CANCELLED**
**Decision (2026-05-06)**: skipped permanently. STATUS.md / BACKLOG.md / PLAN_*.md stay untracked as ephemeral working notes; do not commit, do not `.gitignore`. Applies for the rest of this project.

## Theme: README / surface accuracy

### `[x]` P0.4 — Add "What's NOT in 0.1.0-alpha" callout to README
**Why**: README's "What you get" section lists 6 capabilities (medallion, GenAI grounding, BI via JDBC, Delta Sharing, etc.) without flagging which are blueprint-only. New users may assume gold marts ship working.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: README has a `> **Phase 1 vs Phase 2**: ...` callout listing what is wired (BICC→bronze, OAC install, MCP config) vs stubbed (silver/gold transforms, conformed dimensions, gold marts).

### `[x]` P0.5 — Annotate "Use cases" in README with phase tags
**Why**: README lists 12 use cases. Only ~3 are actually achievable in 0.1.0-alpha (BICC bronze landing, OAC connection install, GenAI grounding on demo gold). The rest depend on Phase 2.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: P0.4 (use the same Phase 1 vs Phase 2 framing)
**Accept**: each use case in §"Use cases" tagged `(0.1.0a ✅)` or `(Phase 2 🚧)`.

### `[~]` ~~P0.6 — Mention `STATUS.md` + `BACKLOG.md` in README~~ — **CANCELLED**
**Decision (2026-05-06)**: skipped — depends on P0.3, which was cancelled. Those files stay untracked working notes, so the README intentionally does not reference them.

# P1 — Phase 2 dataflow (the actual v0.2.0 product)

> Goal: turn `0.1.0-alpha` into `0.2.0`. The three stub modules (`orchestrator/`, `transforms/`, `dimensions/`) become real, the 5 gold marts become wired, and a `.bar` ships as a release artifact. Suggested execution order is reflected in the IDs below; respect dependencies.

## Theme: Foundation (one-shot wiring; everything else depends on this pattern)

### `[x]` P1.1 — Implement `dimensions/dim_supplier.py` (commit `2d44b1d`, live `91ddcbc`+`bee18aa`)
**Why**: Smallest dimension; already prototyped in TC8 (live-validated $3.2B aggregate). Establishes the pattern for the other 4 dims.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**:
- `dimensions/dim_supplier.py` reads `bronze.erp_suppliers`, dedupes on `supplier_number`, handles null IDs (demo pod), writes `silver.dim_supplier`.
- Unit test in `tests/unit/test_dim_supplier.py` covers dedup, null-handling, schema.
- One live test row added to TC8 results (or new TC8b file) verifying production-shape vs demo-shape.

### `[x]` P1.2 — Productize `transforms/gold/supplier_spend.py` (commit `61d1348`, live `618c0c2`)
**Why**: TC8 already proved the SQL on demo pod ($3.2B / 236 records / top vendor `300000047507499` at $892.7M). Wrap it as a transform module — model for the next 4 marts.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: P1.1
**Accept**:
- `transforms/gold/supplier_spend.py` exposes `build(spark, fusion_catalog) → DataFrame`, writes `gold.supplier_spend`.
- Demo-pod / production switch: if `dim_supplier` has populated IDs, join form; else spend-only fallback (resolves bug A4 from STATUS.md §5).
- Unit test on synthetic data.
- Live test re-runs TC8 against `silver.dim_supplier` instead of inline aggregation.

### `[x]` P1.3 — Implement `dimensions/dim_account.py` (commit `d743979`, live `7d765f4`)
**Why**: Required by `gl_balance` mart (P1.7). Read from `bronze.gl_coa` (`CodeCombinationExtractPVO`).
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**:
- Reads `bronze.gl_coa`, surrogate `account_id`, natural `code_combination`, hierarchy attributes.
- Unit test covers empty-coa edge case, parent-child segment handling.
- Hook for custom COA segments (deferred to P2.E1's `docs/customizing.md`).

### `[x]` P1.4 — Implement `dimensions/dim_calendar.py` (commit `9003e00`, live `022245c`)
**Why**: Required by `gl_balance` and `po_backlog`. System-generated (no source PVO).
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**:
- Generates Gregorian + Fiscal calendars for 2020–2030 (configurable range).
- Surrogate `calendar_key`, `fiscal_year`, `fiscal_period`, `calendar_date`.
- Unit test verifies coverage + no gaps.

### `[x]` P1.5 — orchestrator/__init__.py + notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb (Phase α shipped 9e15d79 → 7f57d38; live TC26 closed 2026-06-02, run_id `00bd680f-…`)
**Status (2026-05-17)**: Phase α implementation **shipped** across five atomic commits on `oussama-dev`:
- `9e15d79` P0  — catalog cleanup (bronze_table_name rename, SAAS_BATCH, ar_aging/ap_aging cleanup)
- `c6f4ace` Phase 2 — orchestrator package (errors, registry, runtime, state) + Bundle versioning
- `f113fb2` Phase 3 — orchestrator/__init__.py run loop + resolve_plan + two-phase cascade
- `2df8cc3` Phase 4 — module retrofit: 6 modules gain run_id kwarg + silver_run_id/gold_run_id audit cols (closes P1.5α-fix9)
- `7f57d38` Phase 5 — CLI integration: --inline calls orchestrator.run, migrate-bundle scaffold, status() latest-per-dataset
482 unit tests pass (was 369 at session start). Plus Phase 6 (commit pending): `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb` 3-cell demo + `tests/live/TC26_orchestrator_seed_run.md` procedure doc with expected outputs + failure-mode probes. Live execution on `fusion_bundle_dev` is the closing gate — see TC26 doc for the procedure.

**Why**: Public entry point that wires extract → bronze → silver → gold sequence and persists state to `fusion_bundle_state` Delta table. Resolves P0.2 fully.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: P1.1–P1.4 (shipped).
**Accept**:
- ✅ `orchestrator.run(bundle_path, *, spark=None, mode='seed', datasets=None, layers=None, dry_run=False) → RunSummary`.
- 🟡 Incremental watermarking — Phase β.1 (state-contract infrastructure) shipped: `read_last_watermark` real + DataFrame-API/`spark.sql`-tested, `_resolve_watermark_source` resolver, `RunStep.last_watermark` field, bronze closure captures `extract_started_at - WATERMARK_SAFETY_WINDOW` (1h), `WatermarkMonotonicityError` + monotonicity check, tuple-keyed `succeeded_row_counts` + new `succeeded_last_watermarks` carry-forward. User-facing `--mode incremental` STAYS gated by `NotImplementedError` — flag flip + non-destructive bronze writes (MERGE) land in P1.17. β.1 live evidence pending (TC28 + TC28b clock-skew probe).
- ✅ Notebook at `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb` (3 cells: import, seed run, state-table + audit-col verification).
- ✅ `cli.py` `run` command: `--inline` calls orchestrator directly; REST dispatch path is a stub today (BACKLOG P1.5ε — empirically validated, not wired).
- ✅ Removed the TODO from `commands/run.py:175` (closes P0.2).
- 🟡 Live TC26 evidence on a real tenant — procedure doc shipped (`tests/live/TC26_orchestrator_seed_run.md`); execution pending operator-side credential setup.
- Unit tests for state machine + watermark logic.

## Theme: Remaining dimensions

### `[ ]` P1.6 — Implement `dimensions/dim_item.py`
**Why**: Required by future cross-module marts (PO × Items). Source: `bronze.scm_items` (`ItemExtractPVO`).
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: writes `silver.dim_item`; unit-tested.
**Zero-diff landing contract** (post-P1.5α): `dim_item` is registered in `orchestrator/registry.py` `KNOWN_DEFERRED_DIMS` with this ticket ID. When the module ships, the **only** orchestrator-side edit is moving `"dim_item"` from `KNOWN_DEFERRED_DIMS` into `SILVER_DIMS` with its builder + `depends_on_bronze`. No `schema/bundle.py` default edit, no `examples/*.yaml` edit, no customer-YAML migration. Any deviation from this is a P1.5α regression and blocks merge. The acceptance criterion above must include: "P1.5α deferred test for `dim_item` flips from `deferred` to `success` with no other diff" (one-line test update only).

### `[ ]` P1.7 — Implement `dimensions/dim_org.py` (pending PVO)
**Why**: Cross-module dim; needed for HCM × Finance joins.
**Size**: S (after PVO confirmed); blocked indefinitely without
**Depends on**: customer pod access OR confirmed PVO name from BICC catalog (`catalog probe`); P3.8 unblocks.
**Accept**: PVO name added to `schema/fusion_catalog.py` with ✅; `dim_org.py` writes `silver.dim_org`; unit-tested.
**⚠ Blocker**: PVO name not yet identified. Treat as deferred until P3.8 (customer HCM pod) becomes available.
**Zero-diff landing contract** (post-P1.5α): `dim_org` is **in** the `DimensionsSpec.build` default (`schema/bundle.py:110`), **in** `examples/full_finance.yaml`, and is registered in `orchestrator/registry.py` `KNOWN_DEFERRED_DIMS` with this ticket ID. Today every seed run emits `RunStep(name="dim_org", status="deferred", error_message="P1.7 — …")`. When P1.7 ships, the **only** orchestrator-side edit is moving `"dim_org"` from `KNOWN_DEFERRED_DIMS` into `SILVER_DIMS` with its builder + `depends_on_bronze=("erp_org_hierarchy",)` (or whichever bronze the confirmed PVO lands as). No `schema/bundle.py` default edit, no `examples/full_finance.yaml` edit, no customer-YAML migration — customer bundles that already list `dim_org` just start producing rows. Any deviation from this is a P1.5α regression and blocks merge. The acceptance criterion above must include: "P1.5α deferred test for `dim_org` flips from `deferred` to `success` with no other diff" (one-line test update only).

## Theme: Remaining gold marts (each ~200 LOC; replicate P1.2 pattern)

### `[~]` P1.8 — `transforms/gold/gl_balance.py` (commit pending; live `TC23_gl_balance_results.md`)
**Why**: Period balances by account × period — core CFO dashboard mart.
**Size**: S → **delivered S+** (added BOOTSTRAP Step 7 + COALESCE fix from live finding)
**Depends on**: P1.3 (`dim_account`) ✅; P1.4 (`dim_calendar`) ✅ — but **dim_calendar dep was nominal**, not used in the SQL (grain mismatch: daily dim vs period fact; period context comes from fact's `period_year`/`period_num` directly). See the dim_calendar grain-mismatch note in the live evidence TCs for the deviation rationale.
**Accept**:
- ✅ `transforms/gold/gl_balance.py` follows `supplier_spend.py` pattern (constants → SQL builder → Spark wrapper)
- ✅ Writes `fusion_catalog.gold.gl_balance` Delta — 10,184,102 rows / 22 cols landed live (`actual_flag='A'` only; encumbrance + budget deferred to v0.3)
- ✅ Single LEFT JOIN to `silver.dim_account`; **no `dim_calendar` join** (grain mismatch)
- ✅ NULL-propagation regression caught + fixed: `closing_balance` formula uses `COALESCE(..., 0)` per cast (live `null_closing_balance` = 0)
- ✅ 21 new unit tests; suite 207 → **228** all pass; ruff clean
- ✅ Live evidence: [`tests/live/TC23_gl_balance_results.md`](tests/live/TC23_gl_balance_results.md)
- ✅ BOOTSTRAP extended with **Step 7** (`BalanceExtractPVO` → `bronze.gl_period_balances`) + Step 8 column-shape probe

### `[~]` P1.9 — `transforms/gold/ap_aging.py` (shipped 2026-05-10, TC24 live)
**Why**: Payable age bands (current / 1–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 / 91+). Drives AP aging dashboard.
**Size**: M (plugin-portable schema variants + due-date-mode gate + currency-in-grain)
**Depends on**: bronze.ap_invoices ✅, silver.dim_supplier ✅ (lean path; no ap_payments / ap_aging_periods needed)
**Accept**: ✅ writes `gold.ap_aging` (real mode) or `gold.ap_outstanding_by_invoice_age` (proxy mode) on `fusion_bundle_dev`; 40 unit tests covering both modes + schema variants + decision gate; TC24 live evidence shows per-currency reconciliation `delta = 0.00` across 12 currencies, 100% terms_date provenance, $-126K credits preserved across 5 currencies.
**Shipped**: `transforms/gold/ap_aging.py` (plugin-portable; `due_date_mode='auto'` default + 80% coverage gate; `<> 0` filter invariant; mode-aware `max_days_*` column name). Live evidence: `tests/live/TC24_ap_aging_results.md`.

### `[ ]` P1.10 — `transforms/gold/ar_aging.py`
**Why**: Customer aging — collections KPI.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: bronze.ar_invoices ✅, bronze.ar_receipts ✅
**Accept**: writes `gold.ar_aging`; unit-tested; sample SQL committed.
**Zero-diff landing contract** (post-P1.5α): `ar_aging` is **in** the `GoldSpec.marts` default (`schema/bundle.py:116`), **in** `examples/full_finance.yaml`, and is registered in `orchestrator/registry.py` `KNOWN_DEFERRED_MARTS` with this ticket ID. Today every seed run emits `RunStep(name="ar_aging", status="deferred", error_message="P1.10 — …")`. When P1.10 ships, the **only** orchestrator-side edit is moving `"ar_aging"` from `KNOWN_DEFERRED_MARTS` into `GOLD_MARTS` with its builder + `depends_on_bronze=("ar_invoices", "ar_receipts")` + `depends_on_silver=("dim_supplier", "dim_calendar")` (mirror the `ap_aging` registry entry as the template). No `schema/bundle.py` default edit, no `examples/full_finance.yaml` edit, no customer-YAML migration. Any deviation from this is a P1.5α regression and blocks merge. The acceptance criterion above must include: "P1.5α deferred test for `ar_aging` flips from `deferred` to `success` with no other diff" (one-line test update only). The schema-default ↔ registry invariant lint (`tests/unit/test_registry_default_coverage.py`, shipped in P1.5α) enforces this contract automatically — moving the key from `KNOWN_DEFERRED_MARTS` to `GOLD_MARTS` keeps the lint green.

### `[ ]` P1.11 — `transforms/gold/po_backlog.py`
**Why**: Open POs by supplier × due date — procurement KPI.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: P1.1 (`dim_supplier`), P1.4 (`dim_calendar`); bronze.po_orders ✅, bronze.po_receipts ✅
**Accept**: writes `gold.po_backlog`; unit-tested; sample SQL committed.
**Zero-diff landing contract** (post-P1.5α): `po_backlog` is **in** the `GoldSpec.marts` default (`schema/bundle.py:116`), **in** `examples/full_finance.yaml`, and is registered in `orchestrator/registry.py` `KNOWN_DEFERRED_MARTS` with this ticket ID. Today every seed run emits `RunStep(name="po_backlog", status="deferred", error_message="P1.11 — …")`. When P1.11 ships, the **only** orchestrator-side edit is moving `"po_backlog"` from `KNOWN_DEFERRED_MARTS` into `GOLD_MARTS` with its builder + `depends_on_bronze=("po_orders", "po_receipts")` + `depends_on_silver=("dim_supplier", "dim_calendar")`. No `schema/bundle.py` default edit, no `examples/full_finance.yaml` edit, no customer-YAML migration. Any deviation from this is a P1.5α regression and blocks merge. The acceptance criterion above must include: "P1.5α deferred test for `po_backlog` flips from `deferred` to `success` with no other diff" (one-line test update only). The schema-default ↔ registry invariant lint (`tests/unit/test_registry_default_coverage.py`, shipped in P1.5α) enforces this contract automatically.

## Theme: Plugin-portability follow-ups (round-6 audit)

### `[~]` P1.11a — `dim_account` segment portability (shipped 2026-05-11)
**Why**: `dim_account` hardcoded **six** COA segments with semantic names; tenants with >6 populated segments lost data, tenants with different segment ordering got wrong labels.
**Done**: `dim_account` now emits all 30 positional `segment_01..segment_30` columns by default (configurable via `n_segments`), `code_combination` is built via `CONCAT_WS` over all configured segments (`CONCAT_WS` skips NULLs so sparse tenants produce clean keys), and semantic aliases are tenant-configurable via `semantic_segment_map: Mapping[int, str]` with the Fusion-conventional six as the default (preserves `gl_balance`'s consumer interface — `company`, `cost_center`, etc. all still emitted on the demo pod). Adds `detect_active_segments(spark)` probe helper for orchestrators that want to size `n_segments` per tenant. Validation rejects out-of-range positions, invalid SQL identifiers, and duplicate aliases. 12 new unit tests (test_dim_account 20 → 32).
**Note**: `gl_balance` was subsequently updated (commit `50d450a`) to read positional `da.segment_NN` columns through its own `coa_segment_map` knob, so tenants with non-conventional COA designs work end-to-end without needing to author a mart variant. Old consumer-facing column names (`company`, `cost_center`, `natural_account`, etc.) are preserved by the default map.

### `[ ]` P1.5a — Orchestrator portability surface (per-tenant config plumbing)
**Why**: The mart modules now expose plenty of portability knobs (`dim_account.n_segments` / `semantic_segment_map`, `gl_balance.coa_segment_map` / `actual_flag_filter`, `ap_aging.due_date_mode` / `real_mode_gate_threshold` / `null_invoice_date_policy` / `semantic-cancelled-variant`, `supplier_spend.currency_col`). Each currently has a sensible default, but a multi-tenant production deployment needs the orchestrator (P1.5) to wire these through a per-tenant config (YAML / Vault / Terraform-controlled) so customers don't have to edit Python to onboard their pod.
**Size**: M — depends on P1.5 landing first. Add a tenant-config schema (Pydantic), a config loader, and pass-through wiring through the orchestrator's mart-build entry points.
**Performance hints (orchestrator-side, captured for the design)**:
* `ap_aging.build()` runs a coverage probe before each build (one extra filtered scan of `bronze.ap_invoices`). Correct for portability, but the orchestrator should **cache probe results per run** so multiple marts on the same bronze don't repeat schema/coverage scans.
* `dim_account` defaults to 30 segments — portable but wider than most tenants need. The orchestrator can call `detect_active_segments(spark)` once per refresh and pass `n_segments` to size the dim per-tenant.
* `gl_balance` does a large fact `LEFT JOIN` to a small dim — broadcast-friendly. Spark AQE handles this automatically; **do not add a broadcast hint blindly**. Only add hints after live measurement on a tenant whose shuffle cost is documented.
**Accept**: per-tenant config flows from a single YAML to all four mart modules; orchestrator caches probe results within a refresh; coverage in live evidence on at least one non-saasfademo1 tenant (or a synthesized schema-variant test pod).

### `[~]` P1.5b — Catalog/schema name plumbing (shipped 2026-05-11)
**Why**: `bundle.yaml` declared `aidp.{catalog,bronzeSchema,silverSchema,goldSchema}` and the Pydantic schema accepted them — but no module read them at build time. Every dim/gold module hardcoded `fusion_catalog.X.Y` as `Final[str]` defaults. `commands/run.py:78-79` had the same bug in `status()` (hardcoded `'bronze'` schema for `fusion_bundle_state`).
**Done**: New `scripts/.../config/paths.py` with the `TablePaths` frozen dataclass + `DEFAULT_PATHS` singleton + `from_bundle()` classmethod. Strict SQL-identifier validation (`^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`) at construction — rejects injection, non-strings, leading-digit identifiers, hyphens, dots. Every shipped module (`dim_supplier`, `dim_account`, `dim_calendar`, `supplier_spend`, `gl_balance`, `ap_aging`) accepts `paths: TablePaths | None` on its `build()`; module-level constants derive from `DEFAULT_PATHS` so value strings stay byte-identical (every existing test passes unchanged). Explicit per-table kwargs still win over `paths`. `commands/run.py status()` now uses `TablePaths.from_bundle(bundle).bronze("fusion_bundle_state")`. `ap_aging.build()` resolves `gold_table` AFTER the auto-router resolves `due_date_mode` (critical ordering — F + G build()-level fake-Spark tests lock this invariant). 38 new tests (23 in `test_paths.py` + 14 mart/dim threading tests + 1 status test).
**Source rules**: CLAUDE.md §"What varies per tenant: Tenant-declared policy → bundle.yaml". CONTRIBUTING.md §"Module checklist" + §"Wiring".

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix1 — PLAN §4.4 review corrections (closed 2026-05-15)
**Why**: Read-through of the §4.4 (the `_execute_node` + run-loop pseudocode) surfaced two correctness bugs in the as-drafted code. Both reflected in the plan BEFORE α implementation starts. Single trackable item so the corrections don't get lost between drafting and committing.

**Bug 1 — BICC double-pull on bronze count** (PLAN line 525). `[FIXED in plan 2026-05-15]`
- **Problem**: bronze branch did `df.write...saveAsTable(target); return RunStep.success(..., row_count=df.count())`. `df` is the lazy `extract_pvo()` (`reader.load()`) wrapped with audit columns — calling `.count()` after the write actions the plan a SECOND time, triggering a second BICC HTTP fetch against Fusion. BICC extracts are not idempotent (each call opens a new `_extract_ts` window), so the count could differ from what was just written, and every bronze extract doubles Fusion load on the customer's tenant.
- **Fix**: count from the materialized Delta target — `row_count=spark.table(target).count()`. Applied to PLAN §4.4 lines 525-537. Acceptance-criteria checklist updated with the unit-test contract: fake-Spark stub records every method call on the `extract_pvo` return; assert exactly one action terminator (`saveAsTable`) and zero `.count()` / `.collect()` / `.show()` calls. Silver/gold branches exempt: module contract is that `build()` writes the target inside the call and returns `spark.table(<resolved>)`, so `.count()` is a cheap Delta read.

**Bug 2 — Failure cascade never runs** (PLAN line 477). `[FIXED in plan 2026-05-15 — Option C applied]`
- **Problem**: The success-path branch checks `if step.status == "failed" and node.is_required_upstream(): _skip_dependents(...)`, but `_execute_node` only ever returned `RunStep.success(...)` or **raised** — there was no return path producing `status="failed"`. So that branch was dead code. The exception-path branch caught, wrote a failed step, then `break`d — **without calling `_skip_dependents`**. Net: failed upstreams produced 1 `failed` row + 0 `skipped` rows, contradicting §4.7 and the acceptance criterion that mandates downstream `status="skipped"` cascade rows.
- **Decision (Option C)**: chosen over A and B because it's the only option that respects the data-error vs infrastructure-error distinction — a cardinal data-engineering principle. Pattern aligns with Airflow / Dagster / Databricks Workflows (narrow catch at the unit-of-work boundary, infra exceptions propagate). Option A over-catches (state-write bugs masked as "module failures" — bookkeeping fraud against the operator). Option B is acceptable but maintains two loop paths and requires editing §4.7 prose; Option C matches §4.7 literally.
- **Fix applied to PLAN §4.4**:
  - `_execute_node` body wrapped in try/except; module-dispatch exceptions return `RunStep.failed(node, run_id, mode, exc)`. The unknown-spec `raise TypeError` sits OUTSIDE the try/except so it propagates as an orchestrator bug.
  - Run loop collapsed to a single branch — no separate orchestrator-level try/except around `_execute_node`. Cascade is triggered uniformly via `step.status == "failed"` check after every step.
  - Boundary comment in `_execute_node` docstring documents what belongs inside the try and what doesn't, citing the unit-test invariant.
- **Two new acceptance-criteria tests added to PLAN**:
  - `test_failed_bronze_cascades_to_skipped_silver_and_gold` — stub `extract_pvo` to raise; plan `ap_invoices → dim_supplier → supplier_spend`; assert 1 `failed` + 2 `skipped` rows with correct cross-references, exactly 3 `write_state_row` calls, no later nodes attempted.
  - `test_state_write_failure_propagates_as_uncaught_exception` + `test_unknown_spec_type_raises_typeerror` — orchestrator-infrastructure failures must crash with their real stack trace, NOT get absorbed as a misleading `failed` step.

**Size**: S — plan edits only, no production code. ~45 min total (both bugs).
**Depends on**: nothing. Landed before any α implementation commit.
**Accept** (all met 2026-05-15):
- ✅ Bug 1: PLAN §4.4 + acceptance criteria reflect target-table counting.
- ✅ Bug 2: PLAN §4.4 pseudocode rewritten per Option C; §4.7 prose stays correct as-written ("`_execute_node` caught the exception"); two new tests added to acceptance criteria.
- ✅ Both bugs traceable from the canonical PLAN back to this BACKLOG entry for audit.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix2 — Drop `--mode full` from CLI surface (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: `cli.py:112` used to accept `--mode full` via `click.Choice(["full","incremental","seed"])`. The orchestrator's `Literal["seed","incremental"]` is a type-hint, not runtime-enforced — so `--mode full` would reach `orchestrator.run(...)` unchallenged, pass the `if mode == "incremental"` guard (because `"full" != "incremental"`), and land rows in `fusion_bundle_state` with `mode="full"` — a value outside the documented enum. Worst kind of bug: no exception, no log, silent state-table contract pollution.
**Done** (Option A surface + Option D defense-in-depth):
- ✅ `cli.py:113`: `Choice(["seed", "incremental"])`, default `"seed"`, help text mentions the retired alias.
- ✅ `commands/run.py`: default `"seed"`; type-hint `Literal["seed","incremental"]`.
- ✅ `orchestrator/__init__.py:433-440`: `_VALID_MODES = frozenset({"seed","incremental"})`; entry-point validation raises `UnsupportedModeError` with retired-alias hint (validation runs BEFORE `load_bundle` — zero filesystem / Spark / state side effects on bad mode).
- ✅ `orchestrator/errors.py:53`: `UnsupportedModeError(OrchestratorConfigError, ValueError)` — multi-inherits `ValueError` so legacy callers that catch `ValueError` still trap mode errors (P1.5α-fix6 marker-pattern back-compat).
- ✅ `test_run_cli_rejects_mode_full_at_parse_time` (`test_commands.py:278`): Click parses `--mode full`, exit code 2, `orchestrator.run` patched and `assert_not_called()` confirms parse-time rejection — orchestrator never invoked.
- ✅ `test_mode_full_raises_before_any_io` (`test_orchestrator_run.py:126`): `pytest.raises(UnsupportedModeError, match="full")` + `"retired" in str(exc)` (breadcrumb preservation) + `isinstance(exc, ValueError)` (marker-pattern contract) + `load_bundle` NOT called.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix3 — State-table failure semantics: hard `ensure`, soft per-step write (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: Read-through of the canonical PLAN surfaced a direct contradiction between §4.4 (after Option C was applied for the cascade bug, state writes propagate uncaught) and §4.7 line 767 ("State-table write failure: log + continue"). Both can't be right. The deeper question is whether `fusion_bundle_state` is observability (logs-like; may fail without consequence) or data contract (rows read by future runs and must be reliable). Answer: **both** — Phase α uses it mostly for `status()` human-readable output, but Phase β reads `last_watermark` from it to drive incremental `MERGE INTO`. So pure "log + continue" misses the watermark concern; pure "halt always" kills 45-min bronze re-extracts on 2-second network blips.
**Approach** (Option 4 — hard `ensure`, soft per-step write):
- **Layer 1 (hard)**: `state.ensure_state_table(spark, paths)` at orchestrator start (§4.4 step 5). Creates the table if absent AND probes writeability (INSERT a sentinel row + DELETE; catches "create succeeded but write denied" on tenants with split DDL/DML grants). On any failure: raises uncaught — halts BEFORE any module dispatch so no bronze extract burns Fusion-side load against a structurally inaccessible state table.
- **Layer 2 (soft)**: `_safe_write_state_row(spark, paths, step, console)` in `orchestrator/runtime.py`. Wraps `state.write_state_row` in try/except. On exception: logs WARN with `dataset_id`, `layer`, `status`, `repr(exc)`; returns `False`; does NOT raise. Caller continues. Cascade decisions in the run loop are made from in-memory `step.status`, never from whether the row landed — so state-write failures never affect in-run correctness.
- `_skip_dependents` uses `_safe_write_state_row` internally for the `skipped` rows it writes.
- Update §4.4 run loop, `_execute_node` docstring boundary comment, §4.7 line 767 (make the precondition explicit), file layout in §4.1 (add `_safe_write_state_row` to `runtime.py` listing). **All four edits applied 2026-05-15.**
- Phase β's `read_last_watermark` must handle missing rows gracefully (NULL → full extract, idempotent in seed mode). Documented as a forward-looking constraint; no Phase β code touches yet.
**Acceptance-test changes** (applied to PLAN 2026-05-15):
- **Removed** (was added under Option C): `test_state_write_failure_propagates_as_uncaught_exception` — no longer valid; per-step writes don't halt the run.
- **Added** `test_state_write_failure_logged_and_continues`: stub `state.write_state_row` to raise `OSError("transient")` on second call; assert `_safe_write_state_row` returns `False` on that call but `True` on others; WARN log emitted exactly once with all four fields; loop continues; all in-memory steps produced; `RunSummary` returned normally; `state.write_state_row` called `len(steps)` times (wrapper attempts every write).
- **Added** `test_ensure_state_table_failure_halts_run_before_dispatch`: stub `state.ensure_state_table` to raise `PermissionError("Delta DDL denied")`; assert `orchestrator.run(...)` raises `PermissionError`; `_execute_node` called zero times.
- **Updated** `test_failed_bronze_cascades_to_skipped_silver_and_gold` (the Option C cascade test) to assert calls go through `_safe_write_state_row`, with `state.write_state_row` underneath called 3 times when all writes succeed.
**Size**: S — ~10 LOC of wrapper code + 4 plan edits + 2 unit test changes + 1 unit test update. ~45 min. Plan edits already applied.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix1 (Option C cascade refactor, already applied to plan). The split contract builds on Option C's cascade decoupling — cascades use in-memory state, so soft per-step writes don't affect cascade correctness.
**Done**:
- ✅ PLAN §4.4 run loop calls `_safe_write_state_row(...)`, not `state.write_state_row(...)` directly.
- ✅ PLAN §4.4 `_execute_node` boundary comment describes the soft-vs-hard split.
- ✅ PLAN §4.7 line 767 makes the `ensure`-passed precondition explicit and links to DECISION doc.
- ✅ PLAN §4.1 file layout lists `_safe_write_state_row` under `runtime.py`.
- ✅ PLAN acceptance criteria has the two new tests + updated cascade test.
- ✅ `state.ensure_state_table` writeability probe (INSERT sentinel + DELETE) shipped at `state.py:77-116`.
- ✅ `_safe_write_state_row` SOFT wrapper shipped at `runtime.py:585-612` — try `state.write_state_row` / except `Exception` → `logger.warning(...)` with the 4 required fields + `return False`.
- ✅ `TestStateWriteFailureSemantics.test_state_write_failure_logged_and_continues` (`test_orchestrator_run.py`) — flaky `state.write_state_row` on the 2nd call surfaces 1 WARN with all 4 fields; loop completes; wrapper attempted every step's write; in-memory `RunStep` sequence intact.
- ✅ `TestStateWriteFailureSemantics.test_ensure_state_table_failure_halts_run_before_dispatch` — `PermissionError` from `ensure_state_table` propagates; `_execute_node` patched + `assert_not_called()` confirms zero dispatch attempts.
- ✅ `TestRunCascadeAndAbort.test_failed_bronze_cascades_to_skipped_silver_and_gold` updated with `wraps=`-style patches that count both wrapper invocations and underlying `state.write_state_row` calls — both equal `len(steps)`, proving the run loop persists every step through the SOFT wrapper.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix4 — Layer/dataset filter semantics: intra-plan vs extra-plan dependencies (impl + tests 2026-05-17; live evidence TC26 2026-06-02 — 5 deferred rows + 10 success rows on 15-node DAG demonstrate classification)
**Why**: the §4.2 advertises `layers=["gold"]` as the iterating-on-gold-SQL workflow ("only rebuild gold without re-extracting bronze"). §4.7 simultaneously says any consumer whose dependency is filtered out of the current run hard-fails with `MissingDependencyError`. The two contradict: running `orchestrator.run(layers=["gold"])` would crash on every gold mart's bronze prerequisite.
**Approach** (Option 4 — distinguish intra-plan from extra-plan dependencies):
- **Intra-plan** deps (both consumer and provider in current plan): standard topo-sort + cascade-on-failure as today.
- **Extra-plan** deps (provider filtered out by `datasets=`/`layers=`): preflight via `spark.catalog.tableExists(...)` BEFORE any module dispatch. Missing → `PrerequisiteError` with redirect message naming what's missing and how to fix it.
- **Two distinct error classes**:
  - `MissingDependencyError`: logical — consumer references a `dataset_id` that exists nowhere in the registry. Bundle.yaml typo or registry inconsistency. Raised at `resolve_plan` time.
  - `PrerequisiteError`: data — extra-plan provider's Delta table doesn't exist on disk. User skipped a materialization step. Raised at `_preflight_external_deps` time. Message: *"Prerequisite tables not found: `<catalog>.bronze.ap_invoices` (needed by `'supplier_spend'`). Either: include layer(s) ['bronze'] in --layers, OR run with --datasets ap_invoices first to materialize."*
- New types in `orchestrator/runtime.py`: `ExternalDep` dataclass, `MissingDependencyError`, `PrerequisiteError`, `_preflight_external_deps(spark, deps) → None`.
- New helper in `orchestrator/__init__.py`: `resolve_plan(bundle, datasets, layers, all_nodes, paths) → (list[Node], list[ExternalDep])` — does the topo-sort + intra/extra split atomically.
- §4.4 run loop gains a new step 5.5 (`_preflight_external_deps`) between `ensure_state_table` (step 5, hard) and the dispatch loop (step 6).
- `dry_run` returns both `plan` and `extra_deps` in the RunSummary so customers can see what would dispatch + what they need on disk.
**Plan edits applied 2026-05-15**:
- ✅ §4.2 docstring: `layers=`/`datasets=` clarified — filtered-out deps are external prerequisites, verified by preflight.
- ✅ §4.4 run loop: step 2 calls `resolve_plan(...)` instead of three separate `filter_enabled_*` calls; new step 5.5 calls `_preflight_external_deps(...)`.
- ✅ §4.7 bullet split: `MissingDependencyError` (logical) and `PrerequisiteError` (data) documented as distinct error classes with distinct remediation paths.
- ✅ §4.1 file layout: `ExternalDep` + `MissingDependencyError` + `PrerequisiteError` + `_preflight_external_deps` added to `runtime.py` listing.
- ✅ §5 step-by-step: `runtime.py` task gains the new types + 3 preflight tests; `__init__.py` task gains the `resolve_plan` topology + 2 layer-filter tests + 1 missing-dep test.
- ✅ Acceptance criteria: new "Layer/dataset filter — intra-plan vs extra-plan dependency split" item with three test specs.
**Staleness — out of scope (deferred)**: extra-plan deps that exist on disk but are stale (e.g. bronze last run 3 weeks ago) are NOT detected by `tableExists()`. Tracked as a follow-up (potential P1.X): read `fusion_bundle_state.last_run_at` per extra-plan dep, emit WARN if older than configurable `max_dep_age_days` threshold. Default behavior: no failure, operator visibility only. Rationale for deferral: depends on state-table contract being live-verified (P1.5α-fix3); threshold belongs in bundle.yaml as policy.
**Size**: M — ~30 LOC of `resolve_plan` logic + ~15 LOC of `_preflight_external_deps` + 6 unit tests across two files + the plan edits already applied. ~1h.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix1 (Option C cascade refactor) for the cascade-correctness foundation; P1.5α-fix3 (state-table split contract) for the dispatch-order pattern (`ensure_state_table` → `_preflight_external_deps` → loop). Nothing else.
**Done**:
- ✅ PLAN §4.2, §4.4, §4.7, §4.1, §5, acceptance criteria all updated (2026-05-15).
- ✅ Implementation: `ExternalDep` dataclass + `MissingDependencyError(OrchestratorConfigError)` + `PrerequisiteError(OrchestratorConfigError)` + `resolve_plan` + `_preflight_external_deps` shipped in commits `c6f4ace` (Phase 2) + `f113fb2` (Phase 3). Run-loop dispatch order is `ensure_state_table` → `_preflight_external_deps` → loop (`orchestrator/__init__.py:469-475`).
- ✅ `TestLayerFilterPreflight.test_layers_gold_with_prereqs_present_dispatches_only_gold` — full run with `layers=['gold']`, fake catalog pre-seeded with all extra-plan dep table paths → preflight passes silently → only 3 gold marts dispatch; bronze + silver builders never invoked.
- ✅ `TestLayerFilterPreflight.test_layers_gold_with_missing_prereq_raises_prerequisite_error` — same setup with empty fake catalog → `PrerequisiteError` raised with missing-table list + `--datasets`/`--layers` redirect hint; `_execute_node` patched and `assert_not_called()`.
- ✅ `TestResolvePlan.test_inplan_consumer_with_unknown_dependency_raises_missing_dependency` — registry-inconsistency guardrail (Branch B of `_check_dep_exists_or_raise` at `__init__.py:168`). Patches `GOLD_MARTS["supplier_spend"]` with `depends_on_bronze=("nonexistent_pvo",)`; asserts `MissingDependencyError` names the missing dep AND is NOT a `PrerequisiteError` (load-bearing — bad reference must NOT leak to disk-state-checking).
- ✅ `TestResolvePlan.test_typo_in_dim_raises_missing_dependency` — Branch A coverage (bundle.yaml typo → unknown REQUESTED name). Distinct contract from Branch B above; both branches keep their own test.

**Remaining gate for `[x]` flip**:
- **Live evidence**: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --mode seed --layers gold` against `fusion_bundle_dev` (after a full seed run materialized bronze/silver) producing a RunSummary with only gold marts dispatched. Blocked on BICC credential refresh — same blocker as TC26 full happy-path.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix5 — Plan-doc nomenclature: `password_ref` → `password` (closed 2026-05-15)
**Why**: Two spots in the canonical PLAN still referred to `fusion.password_ref` even though the Pydantic schema field is `fusion.password` (`scripts/.../schema/bundle.py:73`) and §4.4's pseudocode + §4.9's resolver helper already use `bundle.fusion.password`:
- Line 147 — §3.3 bundle-config table row.
- Line 903 — §6 open-question "How does the orchestrator obtain BICC credentials?" answer.
`password_ref` was likely an early draft name from before the unified-sigil pattern (one `str` field accepting literal / `${vault:OCID}` / `${env:VAR}` via `_resolve_password()`) was adopted. The stale references would have misled implementers — `bundle.fusion.password_ref` raises `AttributeError`, but since the references were in prose tables and not in code, the bug stayed dormant.
**Fix applied 2026-05-15** (plan-only, no code change):
- Line 147 — replaced `password_ref` with `password` and added a description of the three accepted value shapes (literal, `${vault:OCID}`, `${env:VAR}`), noting that all dispatch through `_resolve_password(...)` to a `pydantic.SecretStr`.
- Line 903 — rewrote the open-question answer to reference `fusion.password` with the sigil dispatch, explicitly calling out "there is no separate `password_ref` field — earlier plan drafts referred to one, but the schema uses the unified name."
**Size**: XS — two single-paragraph edits. ~5 min.
**Depends on**: nothing.
**Accept**:
- ✅ `grep password_ref` against the canonical PLAN returns only the explanatory "there is no separate `password_ref` field" sentences (deliberate).
- ✅ Line 147 + line 903 align with §4.4 pseudocode (`bundle.fusion.password`) and §4.9 resolver semantics.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix6 — CLI exit-2 contract via `OrchestratorConfigError` marker (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: the §4.5 `_run_inline` pseudocode caught only `NotImplementedError`, but the exit-code table said exit-2 covers "config error, NotImplementedError, or unsupported execution path." After P1.5α-fix2 (mode-validation `ValueError`), §4.4a (`BundleLoadError`), and P1.5α-fix4 (`MissingDependencyError` + `PrerequisiteError`) landed, the catch list became dangerously incomplete — any of those four raising would propagate as a raw Python traceback to the user instead of a clean exit-2 with a redacted message.
**Approach** — marker base class pattern (preferred over flat enumeration):
- Define `OrchestratorConfigError(Exception)` in `orchestrator/runtime.py` as a marker for "user-facing config / pre-dispatch error; CLI prints `str(exc)` and exits 2 without traceback."
- All existing user-facing config errors inherit from it:
  - `BundleLoadError(OrchestratorConfigError)` — was `(Exception)`.
  - `UnsupportedModeError(OrchestratorConfigError, ValueError)` — new (P1.5α-fix2 had said "raise `ValueError(...)`"); multiple-inherits `ValueError` so legacy callers that catch `ValueError` still work.
  - `MissingDependencyError(OrchestratorConfigError)` — was `(Exception)` per P1.5α-fix4.
  - `PrerequisiteError(OrchestratorConfigError)` — was `(Exception)` per P1.5α-fix4.
- `_run_inline` catches `(OrchestratorConfigError, NotImplementedError)`. Single catch site; new error classes just inherit and the CLI never changes.
- Each subclass's `__str__` must be self-explanatory — the CLI prints `str(exc)` directly with no extra framing. PrerequisiteError already includes redirect text; UnsupportedModeError lists valid modes + retired-alias hint; BundleLoadError names the missing env var; MissingDependencyError points at bundle.yaml / registry.
**Why marker over flat-except-list**:
- Source of truth is the class hierarchy, not the CLI catch tuple. Adding a new exit-2 error type is a one-line subclass declaration; the CLI doesn't change.
- Canonical Python idiom (`OSError`, `LookupError`, Click's `UsageError`).
- Lint test catches accidental `class XError(Exception)` regressions at PR time.
**Plan edits applied 2026-05-15**:
- ✅ §4.5 `_run_inline` pseudocode rewritten to catch `(OrchestratorConfigError, NotImplementedError)` with a per-class explanation comment.
- ✅ §4.5 exit-code table expanded — `2` now lists all six covered cases (BundleLoadError, UnsupportedModeError, MissingDependencyError, PrerequisiteError, NotImplementedError, unsupported execution path).
- ✅ §4.4a `BundleLoadError` definition: inherits from `OrchestratorConfigError`; marker class is defined just above with docstring explaining the contract.
- ✅ §4.1 file layout: `runtime.py` listing adds `OrchestratorConfigError` + `BundleLoadError` + `UnsupportedModeError` + `MissingDependencyError` + `PrerequisiteError` + `ExternalDep` + `_preflight_external_deps`.
- ✅ §5 step-by-step `runtime.py` task: ~1 new marker-class lint test added (1 test).
- ✅ Acceptance criteria: new "Exit-2 contract via `OrchestratorConfigError` marker" item with parametrized test (5 error classes), no-traceback assertion, "bug propagates" counter-test, marker-subclass lint.
**Implementation TODOs for P1.5α-fix2 + P1.5α-fix4** (now retroactively constrained by this fix):
- P1.5α-fix2's `UnsupportedModeError`: multi-inherit `(OrchestratorConfigError, ValueError)` — orchestrator entry guard raises it; CLI catches via marker.
- P1.5α-fix4's `MissingDependencyError` and `PrerequisiteError`: both inherit from `OrchestratorConfigError`.
**Size**: XS — ~10 LOC (marker class + 4 inheritance edits) + 1 lint test + 1 parametrized test in `test_commands.py`. ~30 min.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix2 (UnsupportedModeError implementation), P1.5α-fix4 (MissingDependencyError + PrerequisiteError implementations). Plan ordering: this fix's plan edits land first (now); the four subclass `(OrchestratorConfigError, ...)` lines land in code when fix2 + fix4 are implemented.
**Done**:
- ✅ Plan edits applied (above).
- ✅ DECISION doc — not needed; small enough that the BACKLOG entry + plan comments are the contract. `errors.py` contains zero `DECISION_` / `DESIGN_` / `RESEARCH_` filename references (verified by `grep -n "DECISION\|DESIGN\|RESEARCH" scripts/.../orchestrator/errors.py` → no output). Fix6 has no audit-trail dependency on P1.5α-fix11.
- ✅ Implementation shipped in commit `c6f4ace` (Phase 2 — marker class hierarchy in `errors.py:17-93`) + `7f57d38` (Phase 5 — CLI catch at `commands/run.py:123`).
- ✅ Marker class + 6 concrete subclasses (`BundleLoadError`, `BundleVersionMismatchError(BundleLoadError)`, `UnsupportedModeError(OrchestratorConfigError, ValueError)`, `MissingDependencyError`, `PrerequisiteError`, `CredentialResolutionError`) all inherit `OrchestratorConfigError` directly or transitively.
- ✅ `_run_inline` catches `(OrchestratorConfigError, NotImplementedError)` — single catch site, new error classes just inherit and the CLI never changes.
- ✅ 5-case parametrized exit-2 test (`test_run_inline_exits_2_on_orchestrator_config_error`) covers `BundleLoadError` / `UnsupportedModeError` / `MissingDependencyError` / `CredentialResolutionError` / `PrerequisiteError` — each raised from a patched `orchestrator.run`, exit 2 + message printed + no traceback.
- ✅ `test_run_inline_exits_2_on_not_implemented` — `NotImplementedError` case (the explicit second leg of the CLI catch).
- ✅ `test_run_inline_propagates_non_config_bugs_with_traceback` — counter-test: bare `RuntimeError` from `orchestrator.run` does NOT silently exit 2; it propagates via `result.exception` so the operator gets a real traceback. Guards against future `except Exception` broadening.
- ✅ `TestExceptionHierarchy.test_subclass_of_orchestrator_config_error` (`test_orchestrator_runtime.py`) parametrized over 6 cases (`BundleLoadError`, `BundleVersionMismatchError`, `MissingDependencyError`, `CredentialResolutionError`, `PrerequisiteError`, `UnsupportedModeError`) — every direct subclass asserted via `issubclass(cls, OrchestratorConfigError)`.
- ✅ `test_every_public_error_class_inherits_marker` — self-maintaining lint that loops `errors.__all__` and asserts each non-marker class has `OrchestratorConfigError` in MRO. New error classes added to `__all__` are automatically subject to the contract.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix7 — CLI wiring: thread `bundle_path`, pass `datasets=None` by default (impl + tests 2026-05-17; live evidence TC26 2026-06-02 — dispatcher invoked `orchestrator.run(bundle_path=…, datasets=None, layers=None)` with full end-to-end success)
**Why**: the §4.5 `_run_inline` pseudocode had three coupled bugs the reviewer caught:
1. **`bundle_path` not threaded.** Pseudocode signature `_run_inline(bundle_data, mode, dataset_ids)` took the parsed YAML *dict*, but `orchestrator.run(bundle_path=...)` (§4.2 public API) needs the *Path*. The orchestrator re-reads the YAML internally because `_render_env_vars` (§4.4a) must run on raw text BEFORE Pydantic validation. Passing a parsed dict would skip env-var rendering entirely.
2. **Default `datasets=` is over-restrictive bronze-only.** `commands/run.py:47` calls `_resolve_datasets(bundle_data, datasets)` which, when `--datasets` is omitted, returns the full list of enabled `datasets[*].id` from bundle.yaml — those are BICC PVO names (`ap_invoices`, `gl_period_balances`, etc.), all bronze. Silver dim names (`dim_supplier`, `dim_account`) and gold mart names (`supplier_spend`, `ap_aging`) are NOT in `bundle.datasets[]`. Passing that list as `datasets=` to the orchestrator filters silver + gold out. **Worst-kind-of-bug**: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --mode seed` (no `--datasets`) returns exit 0, RunSummary shows 11 bronze success rows, customer thinks everything materialized — silver + gold never dispatched.
3. **`--datasets foo,bar` should pass raw to the orchestrator** for cross-layer registry classification, not get pre-resolved. `--datasets ap_aging` (gold mart name) and `--datasets dim_supplier` (silver dim name) must work — the orchestrator's `resolve_plan` (per P1.5α-fix4) classifies user-named identifiers across all three registries.
**Approach** — apply the reviewer's prescription plus the natural cleanups that fall out:
- **Thread `Path`, not parsed dict.** `_run_inline(bundle_path: Path, mode: str, datasets: list[str] | None, console)` is the new signature. `commands/run.py:run` passes `bundle_path` directly; `orchestrator.run` re-reads the YAML.
- **`datasets=None` is the documented "no filter" sentinel.** CLI parses `--datasets` via inline CSV split: omitted → `None`, present → `[s.strip() for s in datasets.split(",") if s.strip()]`. Raw list passes through unchanged.
- **Inline `_resolve_datasets`, don't rename.** After validation moves to `resolve_plan` (P1.5α-fix4), the helper is a two-line CSV split with no logic. Keeping a function for that is over-engineering; future wildcards/expansion is YAGNI. The two-line expression at the call site reads cleanly.
- **Remove dead-code `if not requested_ids: return 1` branch.** After the fix, `datasets` is either `None` or a non-empty validated list. Empty-plan is an orchestrator concern (returns `RunSummary.empty(...)` → exit 0); typo'd dataset names raise `MissingDependencyError` (exit 2 via `OrchestratorConfigError` marker per P1.5α-fix6).
**Plan edits applied 2026-05-15**:
- ✅ §4.5: pseudocode rewritten with new `_run_inline` signature; CLI flow (`commands/run.py:run` body) added showing the inline CSV split, conditional `dataset_filter` construction, removed `_resolve_datasets` call.
- ✅ Acceptance criteria: new "CLI wires `bundle_path` and `datasets` correctly" item with two test specs (`test_default_inline_passes_bundle_path_and_datasets_none` + `test_inline_passes_datasets_csv_split_raw` with whitespace + empty-segment cases).
**Done**:
- ✅ PLAN §4.5 pseudocode + acceptance criteria updated (2026-05-15).
- ✅ `commands/run.py:85-88`: inline CSV split with whitespace trim + empty-segment drop. `_resolve_datasets` helper deleted; dead-code `if not requested_ids: return 1` branch removed.
- ✅ `_run_inline(bundle_path: Path, mode: str, datasets: list[str] | None, console)` — new signature threads `Path` (not parsed dict) so `_render_env_vars` runs on raw YAML text before Pydantic validation, per §4.4a.
- ✅ `_run_via_aidp_dispatch` signature also takes `bundle_path: Path` + `datasets: list[str] | None` consistently.
- ✅ `datasets=None` is the documented no-filter sentinel; raw user-typed list passes through to `orchestrator.run` unchanged (cross-layer registry classification happens in `resolve_plan`, per P1.5α-fix4 / P1.5α-fix12).
- ✅ `TestRun.test_run_inline_invokes_orchestrator_run` (`test_commands.py:170`) — verifies the call shape: `bundle_path` is a `Path`, `mode="seed"`, `datasets=None` when `--datasets` is omitted. Covers the BACKLOG-spec contract `test_default_inline_passes_bundle_path_and_datasets_none` under the shipped name.
- ✅ `TestRun.test_run_inline_passes_datasets_csv_as_raw_list` (`test_commands.py:202`) — verifies `--datasets " ap_aging , dim_supplier ,,"` parses to `["ap_aging", "dim_supplier"]` (whitespace trimmed, empty segments dropped) and threads as a raw list. Covers the BACKLOG-spec contract `test_inline_passes_datasets_csv_split_raw` under the shipped name.

**Remaining gate for `[x]` flip**:
- **Live evidence (TC26)**: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --mode seed` (no `--datasets`) on `fusion_bundle_dev` produces a RunSummary with all 11 bronze + 3 silver + 3 gold success rows (the actual bug Bug 2 would have hidden — silver/gold rows MUST be present). Blocked on BICC credential refresh — same blocker as fix4's live-evidence gate.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix9 — Module retrofit: `run_id` kwarg + `<layer>_run_id` audit column (impl + tests 2026-05-17 in commit `2df8cc3`; live evidence TC26 2026-06-02 — SOX-trail JOIN matches 4018/4018 silver + 131/131 gold)
**Why**: PLAN §3.1 widens every silver/gold `build()` signature to accept `run_id: str | None = None`, and §3.5a adds `silver_run_id` / `gold_run_id` audit columns. PLAN §4.4 `_execute_node` calls `node.builder(spark, paths=paths, run_id=run_id)` — but the six shipped modules' live signatures don't accept `run_id` today. Without this retrofit, the first silver/gold dispatch in P1.5α will TypeError on `unexpected keyword argument 'run_id'`. The old §8 "Modules untouched" acceptance criterion has been replaced (in-plan) by an explicit Module-retrofit criterion — this entry tracks the mechanical work.
**Files touched** (6 modules + their tests):
- `scripts/.../dimensions/dim_supplier.py` (build + SQL builder + `SOURCE_BRONZE_TABLE` consumers)
- `scripts/.../dimensions/dim_account.py`
- `scripts/.../dimensions/dim_calendar.py`
- `scripts/.../transforms/gold/supplier_spend.py`
- `scripts/.../transforms/gold/gl_balance.py`
- `scripts/.../transforms/gold/ap_aging.py`
- Paired unit test files in `tests/unit/test_<module>.py` (column-list expectations + new `run_id` parametrized tests)
**Per-module change** (mechanical, ~10 LOC + 1 test edit each):
1. Add `run_id: str | None = None` keyword-only kwarg to `build()` and `build_<mart>_sql()` signatures.
2. In the SQL builder, append `, {run_id_sql} AS <layer>_run_id` to the SELECT list — where `run_id_sql = f"'{run_id}'"` if set, `"NULL"` otherwise.
3. Update existing column-list assertion tests to include the new column.
4. Add `test_<module>_emits_layer_run_id_when_set` + `test_<module>_emits_null_layer_run_id_when_unset` per-module.
**Size**: M — ~60 LOC of code + ~12 new tests + ~6 existing-test edits. ~1h total.
**Depends on**: §3.1 / §3.5a / §4.4 (B3) — landed in plan, awaiting implementation in the same commit as `orchestrator/__init__.py`.
**Done**:
- ✅ All 6 shipped silver/gold modules (`dim_supplier`, `dim_account`, `dim_calendar`, `supplier_spend`, `gl_balance`, `ap_aging`) accept `run_id: str | None = None` on both `build()` and `build_<mart>_sql()` without TypeError. Per-module `_run_id_audit_sql(run_id)` helper emits `'<run_id>' AS <layer>_run_id` when set, `NULL AS <layer>_run_id` when not.
- ✅ `tests/unit/test_module_run_id_audit.py` — dedicated test file with 18+ tests covering: `test_with_run_id_embeds_literal` (6 modules) + `test_without_run_id_emits_null` (6 modules) + `test_build_signature_has_run_id` (per module). Plus `test_uuid_run_id_embeds_safely` (parametrized) and `test_quote_in_run_id_is_escaped` — SQL-injection-safety guards via run_id.
- ✅ All existing column-list expectation tests in `test_<module>.py` updated to include the new audit column; no other test regresses (496/496 unit tests pass).
- ✅ CLAUDE.md `"Audit columns are non-negotiable"` rule satisfied — bronze (`_extract_ts` etc.), silver (`silver_run_id`), gold (`gold_run_id`) all listed.
- ✅ SOX-trail JOIN silver↔state validated live for `dim_calendar` (4018 rows) in TC26 redacted commits `7889e64` + `35aa5ec`.

**Remaining gate for `[x]` flip**:
- **Live evidence**: `SELECT silver_run_id, gold_run_id FROM silver.dim_supplier UNION ... FROM gold.ap_aging` returns non-NULL run_ids matching `fusion_bundle_state.run_id` for every row across **all 6 shipped modules** (TC26 captured `dim_calendar` only; the rest are blocked on BICC credential refresh — same blocker as fix4 + fix7).

**Cross-ref**: §3.1 (signatures), §3.5a (audit-col contract), §4.4 (dispatch threading), §8 module-retrofit acceptance criterion (supersedes "Modules untouched"). Shipped in commit `2df8cc3` (P1.5α Phase 4 — module retrofit).

### `[ ]` P1.5α-fix10 — Move `_LITERAL_WARN_EMITTED` flag out of module-level state (Blocker-1.3 follow-up, 2026-05-17)
**Why**: `_resolve_password` in `orchestrator/runtime.py` uses a module-level `bool` flag to ensure the literal-password WARN fires exactly once per run. This is correct for α (one process, one orchestrator run), but it's brittle for two future scenarios:
- **Long-running processes** (REST jobRuns dispatch via P1.5ε, or Airflow-style scheduling): one process executes many runs back-to-back; the flag never resets after the first run, so subsequent runs with literal passwords surface zero WARNs.
- **Parallel orchestrator invocations** in the same process (post-P3.10 parallel execution): two runs share the module-level state; one run silences the other's WARN.

Today an autouse pytest fixture handles test isolation (see PLAN §4.9 "Test isolation for the literal-warn flag"); production correctness is preserved by the one-process-one-run assumption that holds for the `--inline` and laptop-terminal-REST surfaces.

**When to revisit**: any of (a) P1.5ε REST dispatch becomes a long-running process pattern, (b) P3.10 parallel execution lands, (c) a contributor reports the post-first-run silence as a real customer issue.

**Fix sketch**: introduce a `RunContext` (or extend `RunSummary` with builder-pattern state) that carries per-run state including `warned_about_literal: bool`. Thread through `_resolve_password(value, *, ctx: RunContext)`. The module-level flag goes away.

**Size**: S — ~30 LOC orchestrator refactor + signature change at 2 call sites + remove autouse fixture (replaced by per-test `RunContext()` construction). ~1h.
**Depends on**: nothing today; revisit when triggered.
**Accept**:
- `_resolve_password` no longer references module-level state.
- The autouse `_reset_literal_warn_flag` fixture in `tests/unit/conftest.py` is removed (each test instantiates its own `RunContext`).
- Two new tests: (a) two `RunContext` instances in the same process produce independent WARN counts; (b) long-lived process with three sequential `RunContext`s + literal passwords emits exactly 3 WARNs total (one per context).
**Cross-ref**: PLAN §4.9 (`_LITERAL_WARN_EMITTED` definition + autouse fixture); R3 (the WARN-once requirement that motivated the flag).

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix11 — Scrub references to local-only working notes (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: PLAN / DECISION / DESIGN / RESEARCH / BOOTSTRAP files at the repo root were originally written as committable working notes. The team chose to keep them local-only (moved to `dev/`, gitignored) — they contain step-level identifiers and internal commentary not suitable for the public repo. That left tracked code/docs with ~40 references to filenames that don't exist in the public repo — broken cross-links for any contributor browsing the source.

**Done**:
- ✅ All public-facing references to local-only working-note files scrubbed from tracked code, docstrings, test prose, live-evidence docs, and BACKLOG entries.
- ✅ Operator-facing error messages (e.g. the retired-mode hint in `UnsupportedModeError`) no longer cite local-only filenames; the substantive hints stay.
- ✅ Production docstrings (`state.py`, `runtime.py`, `__init__.py`) keep their inline contract descriptions but drop citation filenames.
- ✅ `commands/run.py` REST-stub message rewritten to describe the status without citing internal-only research notes.
- ✅ Live-evidence docs under `tests/live/` (TC22/TC23/TC26) updated to describe the internal bootstrap / research procedure without filename links.
- ✅ BACKLOG entries' Why/Done blocks dropped citation filenames; the substantive rationale stays inline in each entry.
- ✅ `dev/` was added to `.gitignore` in a prior step; the local-only files live there.
- ✅ Post-scrub verification: the canonical `git grep -nE '<file-pattern set>' -- scripts/ tests/ BACKLOG.md CLAUDE.md CONTRIBUTING.md README.md` returns 0 hits.
- ✅ BACKLOG fix2 + fix3 entries flipped from `[~]` → `[x]` in the same commit (audit-trail gate closed by reference scrub). fix4 stays `[~]` (live-evidence gate still open). fix6 was independent and shipped at `[x]` in its own close-out.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix12 — Validate `--datasets` / `--layers` filter inputs against bundle plan (post-α blocking bug, shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: `resolve_plan` at `orchestrator/__init__.py:126-135` filtered names already in `all_specs` via `_matches_filter` — but requested `datasets=` names absent from the bundle plan were never validated or rejected. Impact: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --datasets ap_invoies` (typo of `ap_invoices`) returned an empty plan and exited 0 via `RunSummary.empty(...)` — an operator could believe a scoped refresh ran while no table changed. This violated the canonical PLAN (typoed filter names hard-fail) and `commands/run.py:78-84` (CLI docstring promises `MissingDependencyError` for unknown names).
**Done**:
- ✅ `resolve_plan` validates `set(datasets) - set(all_specs)` BEFORE the existing `_matches_filter` loop; raises `MissingDependencyError` listing the unknown name(s) + available bundle names (`__init__.py` step 1a).
- ✅ Same guardrail for `layers=`: `set(layers) - _VALID_LAYERS` → `MissingDependencyError` listing offenders + valid layer enum (`{"bronze", "silver", "gold"}`).
- ✅ `_VALID_LAYERS` imported from `.registry` (already exported at `registry.py:51, 293`); no new symbol introduced.
- ✅ `TestResolvePlan.test_typoed_datasets_filter_raises_missing_dependency` — `datasets=["ap_invoies"]` → `MissingDependencyError` with the typo + available names listed.
- ✅ `TestResolvePlan.test_typoed_datasets_filter_with_mixed_valid_and_invalid` — `["dim_supplier", "bogus_name_1", "bogus_name_2"]` → both unknown names surface (presence of a valid name doesn't excuse invalids).
- ✅ `TestResolvePlan.test_typoed_layers_filter_raises_missing_dependency` — `layers=["gols"]` → `MissingDependencyError` with the typo + valid layer enum.
- ✅ `TestRun.test_run_inline_typoed_datasets_exits_2_no_traceback` (CLI integration) — `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --mode seed --datasets ap_invoies` exits 2, output contains `"ap_invoies"`, no traceback (the OrchestratorConfigError marker catch works for this case).
- ✅ Existing `test_datasets_filter_targets_specific_names` + `test_layer_filter_creates_extra_deps` unchanged — happy-path filter behavior is preserved.
**Audit-trail status**: no DECISION-doc dependency. `errors.py` doesn't reference any working-note file; the fix is a pure validation tightening. Flips directly to `[x]` (no P1.5α-fix11 gate).
**Cross-ref**: reviewer-flagged blocking bug at `__init__.py:126-135`; the typoed-filter contract; `commands/run.py:78-84` CLI docstring.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix13 — Wire `--layers` through the CLI (shipped 2026-05-21)

**Done**:
- ✅ `cli.py:117` gains `@click.option("--layers", default=None, …)` mirroring `--datasets`.
- ✅ `cli.py:121` callback signature accepts `layers: str | None` and threads to `commands/run.py::run`.
- ✅ `commands/run.py::run` accepts `layers` parameter, parses CSV the same shape as `datasets`, threads to both `_run_inline` and `_run_via_aidp_dispatch`.
- ✅ `_run_inline` passes `layers=layers` to `orchestrator.run(...)`. `_run_via_aidp_dispatch` plumbs the parameter through its (stub) signature so future P1.5ε wiring inherits it.
- ✅ 2 new tests in `tests/unit/test_commands.py::TestRun`:
  - `test_run_inline_with_layers_filter_passes_through` — `--inline --layers gold` reaches `orchestrator.run` with `layers=["gold"]`, `datasets=None`.
  - `test_run_inline_with_layers_and_datasets_combined` — both filters mutually compatible (`--layers bronze, silver --datasets ap_invoices` → both reach the orchestrator).
- ✅ No new validation in the CLI layer — `resolve_plan` already handles unknown layer names via `MissingDependencyError` (P1.5α-fix12).

**Cross-ref**: closes the P1.5α-fix4 live-evidence gate (a `--layers gold` run against `fusion_bundle_dev` is now command-line addressable; one live dispatch closes both fix4 and fix13).

---

**Original spec follows (preserved for the rationale):**

**Why**: `orchestrator.run(...)` accepts `layers=` (`orchestrator/__init__.py:102, 421, 440`), `resolve_plan` validates `--layers` typos via P1.5α-fix12 (`__init__.py:140-146`), `runtime.py:325` cites `--datasets / --layers` in its `PrerequisiteError` redirect, and `test_orchestrator_run.py:375, 594` exercise `--layers` end-to-end. But `cli.py:111-132` declares only `--mode` / `--datasets` / `--inline` — and `commands/run.py:117-121` calls `orchestrator.run(..., datasets=datasets)` with no `layers=` parameter at all. The path `cli.py → commands/run.py → orchestrator.run(...)` hardcodes `layers=None` end-to-end. Today the only way to do a "rebuild gold from existing bronze+silver" run is to import `orchestrator.run` from Python, defeating the "CLI is the contract" principle (CLAUDE.md).

**Repro**: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --mode seed --layers gold` → `Error: No such option: --layers` (Click rejects unknown options before reaching `commands/run.py`). This is exactly why P1.5α-fix4's `[x]` flip is stuck (see that entry's §"Remaining gate"): the live-evidence command invokes a flag that doesn't exist.
**Size**: XS — one Click option + thread the value through two call sites + one unit test. ~30 min.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix12 (filter-input validation already lives in `resolve_plan`, so the new flag inherits the typo-guard for free).
**Accept**:
- `cli.py:117` gains `@click.option("--layers", default=None, help="Comma-separated layer names to filter (bronze, silver, gold). Mutually compatible with --datasets — both apply.")`. Type signature mirrors `--datasets` (CSV → `list[str] | None`).
- `commands/run.py:run(...)` accepts `layers: str | None = None`, parses the same way as `datasets` (CSV split + strip, empty → `None`), and threads to `_run_inline(...)` / `_run_via_aidp_dispatch(...)`.
- `_run_inline` passes `layers=layer_filter` to `orchestrator.run(...)`. No new validation in the CLI layer — `resolve_plan` already handles typos via `MissingDependencyError`.
- New test `TestRun.test_run_inline_with_layers_filter_passes_through` in `test_commands.py` (or `test_orchestrator_run.py`): `runner.invoke(["run", "--inline", "--mode", "seed", "--layers", "gold"])` reaches `orchestrator.run` with `layers=["gold"]` — assert via `mock.patch` on `orchestrator.run`.
- Existing `--datasets` tests unchanged.
- Live evidence — once shipped, run the P1.5α-fix4 gate command against `fusion_bundle_dev`: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --mode seed --layers gold` produces a RunSummary with only gold marts dispatched. That single live run closes both fix4 and fix13 simultaneously.
**Cross-ref**: P1.5α-fix4 §"Remaining gate" (BACKLOG:299-300); P1.5α-fix12 (the typo-guard fix13 inherits); `cli.py:117`; `commands/run.py:40-97`; `orchestrator/__init__.py:102, 440`.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix14 — `resolve_plan` rejects undeclared upstreams (shipped 2026-05-21)

**Done**:
- ✅ `resolve_plan` at `orchestrator/__init__.py:207-262` now distinguishes (A) declared-but-filtered (legitimate `ExternalDep`, preserved) from (B) never-declared-at-all (rejected). For each consumer-upstream pair, if `dep_name not in all_specs`, the offender is collected to `undeclared_deps`; after the consumer loop, a single consolidated `MissingDependencyError` is raised listing every offender with per-line remediation:
  ```
  bundle.yaml is missing N upstream declaration(s) — refusing to run with
  undeclared dependencies (which would silently rebuild from stale on-disk
  tables or trigger a misleading PrerequisiteError):
    • bronze 'ap_invoices' (required by 'ap_aging') — add it to bundle.datasets
    • silver 'dim_supplier' (required by 'supplier_spend') — add it to bundle.dimensions.build
  ```
- ✅ 5 new `TestResolvePlan` unit tests in `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_run.py` covering all three undeclared-upstream call sites + case-A regression + multi-offender accumulation:
  - `test_undeclared_bronze_upstream_raises_missing_dependency` — `GoldMartSpec.depends_on_bronze` call site
  - `test_undeclared_silver_upstream_raises_missing_dependency` — `GoldMartSpec.depends_on_silver` call site (reviewer catch #1)
  - `test_undeclared_bronze_upstream_for_silver_dim_raises_missing_dependency` — `SilverDimSpec.depends_on_bronze` call site (reviewer catch #2 — a future refactor could break this branch alone; without this test the regression would slip through)
  - `test_declared_bronze_filtered_out_becomes_external_dep` — locks in case (A) preservation (the `--layers gold` `ExternalDep` path must NOT break)
  - `test_multiple_undeclared_upstreams_accumulated_in_one_error` — accumulate-vs-fail-fast contract
- ✅ Full unit suite green: 503 passed (was 498, +5 regression tests).

**Cross-ref**: P1.5α-fix15 (depends on fix14 — shares the `all_specs` construction site) can now proceed against a clean upstream-declaration contract.

**Original spec follows (preserved for the rationale + reviewer-flagged failure modes):**

**Why**: `resolve_plan` treats every upstream not in `in_plan_names` as an `ExternalDep` to be preflighted on disk (`orchestrator/__init__.py:207-222`) — but `in_plan_names` is derived from `all_specs`, which only contains names declared in `bundle.{datasets, dimensions.build, gold.marts}`. The implementation conflates two scenarios:
- **(A) Declared but filtered out**: operator declared the upstream in bundle.yaml, then excluded it for this run via `--datasets`/`--layers`. Legitimate `ExternalDep` — preflight against the on-disk Delta table is the correct contract (P1.5α-fix4's design intent at BACKLOG:271-273).
- **(B) Never declared at all**: operator forgot to declare the upstream in bundle.yaml. Today this becomes an `ExternalDep` and silently passes preflight whenever a stale Delta table happens to exist on disk — gold rebuilds from undeclared, possibly-weeks-old bronze with **no warning**.

Concrete failure modes (live-confirmed by reviewer):

```yaml
# Bundle A — minimal misconfig
datasets: []
dimensions:
  build: []
gold:
  marts: [supplier_spend]   # depends on ap_invoices (bronze) + dim_supplier (silver)
```
`resolve_plan` returns plan `['supplier_spend']` with `extra_deps=[ap_invoices, dim_supplier]`. Two paths from here, both broken:

- **Stale tables on disk**: `_preflight_external_deps` passes via `tableExists(...)`, gold rebuilds from undeclared, possibly-weeks-old data. **Zero warnings, zero auditability.** Operator's intent — "I forgot to declare upstream, please refuse" — is silently inverted into "use whatever's lying around".
- **Tables missing on disk**: `PrerequisiteError` fires with redirect message "*include layer(s) ['bronze'] in --layers, OR run with --datasets ap_invoices first*" (`runtime.py:325`). But following that hint loops: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --inline --datasets ap_invoices` hits P1.5α-fix12's typo-guard at `__init__.py:129` and exits 2 with `--datasets contains name(s) not in the bundle plan: ['ap_invoices']`. The error message tells the operator to do something fix12 then explicitly rejects. Embarrassing UX loop — the two contracts contradict each other when the upstream is undeclared.

This is distinct from the deferred staleness concern at P1.5α-fix4 §"Staleness — out of scope" (BACKLOG:288), which covers declared-but-old bronze. fix14 closes the upstream-declaration gate; the staleness watermark is a separate follow-up.

**Approach**: In `resolve_plan`, before `_add_extra(...)` at `__init__.py:213, 218, 222`, check `if dep_name not in all_specs:` → `raise MissingDependencyError(...)`. Message names the consumer, the missing upstream, and tells the operator to declare it in `bundle.datasets` / `bundle.dimensions.build`. The existing `_check_dep_exists_or_raise` (lines 191-205) covers a different contract (registry consistency — "is this name knowable to the orchestrator?"); fix14 covers the bundle-declaration contract ("did the operator opt in?"). Both must pass.

**Size**: S — ~10 LOC of conditional in `resolve_plan` + 2 unit tests + message-shape decision (single error vs. accumulated list of all undeclared deps). ~1h.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix13 (need `--layers` wired to construct the test scenario for case A — declared-but-filtered — at the CLI layer); P1.5α-fix4 (the `ExternalDep` plumbing).
**Accept**:
- New branch in `resolve_plan` (`__init__.py:207-222`): for each consumer's upstream, if `dep_name not in all_specs`, raise `MissingDependencyError` with message naming consumer, upstream layer, upstream name, and the remediation (which bundle.yaml section to add it to). Accumulate across all consumers if multiple are missing — one error listing every offender beats N separate raises.
- Existing `ExternalDep` path preserved for the legitimate case: `dep_name in all_specs and dep_name not in in_plan_names`.
- `TestResolvePlan.test_undeclared_bronze_upstream_raises_missing_dependency` — `bundle.gold.marts=["ap_aging"]` + `bundle.datasets=[]` + no filter → `MissingDependencyError` naming `ap_invoices` AND the bundle section to add it to. Distinct from existing `test_typoed_datasets_filter_raises_missing_dependency` (P1.5α-fix12 — covers filter-input typos, not bundle-omission).
- `TestResolvePlan.test_declared_bronze_filtered_out_becomes_external_dep` — `bundle.datasets=[ap_invoices]` + `bundle.gold.marts=[ap_aging]` + `layers=["gold"]` → `ExternalDep("ap_invoices", "bronze", "ap_aging")` in the plan; no error. Locks in case (A) preservation.
- `TestResolvePlan.test_multiple_undeclared_upstreams_accumulated_in_one_error` — gold mart declares two bronze deps; neither in `bundle.datasets` → single `MissingDependencyError` names both. Operator shouldn't have to fix-rerun-fix-rerun.
**Cross-ref**: reviewer-flagged latent bug at `orchestrator/__init__.py:207-222`; P1.5α-fix4 §"Approach" (BACKLOG:271-273) — design intent of "extra-plan = filtered out", which fix14 enforces; P1.5α-fix4 §"Staleness" (BACKLOG:288) — separate deferred concern (declared-but-old, not undeclared); P1.5α-fix12 (`__init__.py:129`) — the typo-guard that closes the embarrassing loop in this entry's "Tables missing on disk" failure mode once fix14 declines the offending bundle upfront.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix15 — Honor `DatasetSpec.enabled` + disabled-specific error wording (shipped 2026-05-21)

**Done** (Option A: honor the flag; grew beyond the original ~3 LOC to ~25 LOC across two error builders + 4-axis `undeclared_deps` tuple after plan-review rounds caught misleading-remediation gaps):

- ✅ `orchestrator/__init__.py:117-129` skips disabled datasets from `all_specs` and tracks their ids in a sibling `disabled_datasets: set[str]`.
- ✅ `undeclared_deps` widened to a 4-axis tuple `(consumer, consumer_layer, dep_layer, dep_name)` — the consumer's layer (derived via `_layer_for_spec(all_specs[consumer])`) is required for the disabled-state error wording to name the correct `bundle.yaml` section.
- ✅ **fix14's consumer-upstream error builder** (the consolidated raise at `__init__.py:280-305`) gets a two-branch `if dep_name in disabled_datasets:` check. Disabled branch emits: `"bronze 'ap_invoices' is disabled in bundle.datasets (required by 'supplier_spend') — set enabled: true or remove 'supplier_spend' from bundle.gold.marts"`. Plain undeclared branch (existing fix14 wording) is preserved for truly-missing names.
- ✅ **fix12's `--datasets` filter validator** (`__init__.py:131-170`) gets a parallel `disabled_in_filter` vs `truly_unknown` split. Disabled filter ids get their own message: `"--datasets references disabled name(s): ['ap_invoices']. Either set `enabled: true` in bundle.datasets, or remove them from --datasets."`
- ✅ 4 new `TestResolvePlan` tests in `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_run.py` covering all three disabled-state surfaces:
  - `test_disabled_dataset_excluded_from_plan` — happy path (disabled dataset absent from plan + extra_deps)
  - `test_disabled_dataset_with_gold_consumer_raises_disabled_specific_error` — gold-consumer wording (`bundle.gold.marts`); rejects misleading `"add it to bundle.datasets"`
  - `test_disabled_dataset_with_silver_consumer_raises_disabled_specific_error` — silver-consumer wording (`bundle.dimensions.build`); rejects wrong section `bundle.gold.marts` (reviewer catch — locks the `consumer_layer` derivation contract)
  - `test_datasets_filter_with_disabled_id_raises_disabled_specific_error` — filter-input wording; rejects generic `"not in the bundle plan"`
- ✅ 1 schema round-trip test in `tests/unit/test_bundle_schema.py::test_dataset_enabled_false_roundtrips_cleanly` — confirms `enabled: false` parses cleanly AND survives `model_dump → model_validate`. Without this, a silent schema regression would break fix15's honor-check at `resolve_plan`.
- ✅ All 5 disabled-state tests use **fully-explicit minimal YAML** (every `bundle.*` section listed, with empty `[]` where there's no consumer) — suppresses `DimensionsSpec.build` + `GoldSpec.marts` defaults that would otherwise inject undeclared upstreams and pollute error-message assertions for reasons unrelated to the disabled-state contract.
- ✅ Full unit suite green: **510 passed** (was 503 post-fix14, +7 regression tests).

**Cross-ref**: depends on P1.5α-fix14 (shares the `all_specs` construction site; fix14's error builder is the integration point for the disabled-specific wording branch). Reviewer caught two UX traps before code landed: (i) consumer-upstream needed `consumer_layer` axis so silver consumers get pointed at `bundle.dimensions.build` not `bundle.gold.marts`; (ii) filter-input path needed its own disabled-specific branch in fix12's validator — without it, `--datasets disabled-name` would dead-end with the misleading "edit bundle.yaml" message even though the entry IS in the bundle.

---

**Original spec follows (preserved for the rationale + reviewer-flagged dead-field bug):**

**Why**: `schema/bundle.py:104` declares `enabled: bool = True` on `DatasetSpec` — implying operators can opt a single bronze extract out of a run by setting `enabled: false`. But `orchestrator/__init__.py:118` builds `all_specs` by iterating `bundle.datasets` with **no `enabled` check**: every declared dataset becomes part of `in_plan_names` regardless. The field is dead weight that silently advertises a feature the orchestrator doesn't implement.

**Repro**:
```yaml
datasets:
  - id: ap_invoices
    enabled: false              # operator's intent: skip this bronze for now
gold:
  marts: [supplier_spend]
```
`resolve_plan(bundle, datasets=None, layers=None)` → plan still contains `ap_invoices`, BICC extract runs, bronze table is rebuilt. The operator's opt-out is silently ignored. Worse, there's no signal that the field was even read — no WARN, no validation error.

**Two acceptable resolutions** (pick one; defer to operator-experience):

(A) **Honor it**: in the `for ds in bundle.datasets` loop at `__init__.py:118`, skip entries where `ds.enabled is False`. Same treatment for `DimensionsSpec`/`GoldSpec` if/when they grow an `enabled` shape (they don't today — `dimensions.build` and `gold.marts` are `list[str]`, no per-entry knobs). Add a parametrized test in `test_orchestrator_run.py` confirming the disabled dataset never appears in the resolved plan. Operator gets a clean per-dataset opt-out without rewriting `--datasets` CSVs.

(B) **Remove it**: drop `enabled` from `DatasetSpec`. Add a `validate_legacy_enabled_field` model_validator that catches old bundles using the field and raises with a migration message ("use `--datasets <ids>` to scope a single run; bundle.yaml is the durable declaration of *what exists*, the CLI flag is the per-run filter"). Cleaner separation of "declared" vs "runnable today" — bundle.yaml stays declarative.

**Recommendation**: (A). The cost is ~3 LOC; the alternative requires a deprecation cycle and customer migrations for a feature that's already part of the schema contract. Honoring matches operator intuition (set it in YAML, it stays disabled across runs without remembering a CLI flag every time).

**Size**: XS — ~5 LOC orchestrator + 1 schema-validator test + 2 plan-resolution tests. ~30 min.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix14 (the all_specs construction loop is where both fixes intersect; fix14 lands first to establish the all_specs / in_plan_names contract cleanly).
**Accept (Option A)**:
- `orchestrator/__init__.py:118` loop becomes `for ds in bundle.datasets: if ds.enabled: all_specs[ds.id] = _resolve_bronze(ds.id)`. Disabled datasets never enter `all_specs`, so downstream consumers that depend on them trigger fix14's `MissingDependencyError` ("declared upstream `ap_invoices` is disabled — re-enable it or remove `supplier_spend` from `bundle.gold.marts`").
- New test `TestResolvePlan.test_disabled_dataset_excluded_from_plan` — bundle with one `enabled: true` and one `enabled: false` dataset → plan contains only the enabled id; the disabled id is absent from both `plan` and `extra_deps`.
- New test `TestResolvePlan.test_disabled_dataset_with_dependent_consumer_raises` — `ap_invoices.enabled: false` + `gold.marts: [supplier_spend]` (which depends on `ap_invoices`) → `MissingDependencyError`. Wording differentiates from "never declared" — names the disabled status explicitly so the operator knows to flip the flag, not add a new datasets entry.
- `test_bundle_schema.py` gets a round-trip test confirming `enabled: false` parses cleanly and the field survives a re-serialize.
**Cross-ref**: reviewer-flagged dead-field bug at `orchestrator/__init__.py:118` + `schema/bundle.py:104`; P1.5α-fix14 (shares the `all_specs` construction site).

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix17 — Preflight bronze-PVO schema probe (shipped 2026-05-21)
**Why**: TC26 full happy-path burned 32 minutes of cluster compute + wrote 14.7M bronze rows before dying on PVO #10 with `DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031 - Schema: SCM not found`. The catalog declared `schema="SCM"` for `po_receipts` and `scm_items`; BICC on saasfademo1 only publishes a `"Financial"` offering. Same class of failure (catalog drift / tenant variance / BICC unreachable) will bite every customer on first-tenant adoption — and at 32min/run, the cost compounds fast across the discovery loop. Need a cheap fail-fast probe before the orchestrator commits to the real extract loop.

**Done**:
- ✅ New module `orchestrator/preflight.py` — iterates `plan` for every `BronzeExtractSpec`, calls `extract_pvo()` + `df.schema` (BICC's `inferSchema` metadata-only roundtrip, ~1-2s per PVO, no data transfer, no `saveAsTable`). Catches `BaseException` (Py4JJavaError inherits from it). Classifies failures via message inspection (`DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031` → "BICC offering schema not found on this tenant"; `401`/`Unauthorized` → credential rejection; `Connection refused`/`UnknownHost` → unreachable). Aggregates failures — operator gets ONE consolidated `BronzeSchemaProbeError` listing every offending PVO with classification + hint, not N separate exceptions.
- ✅ New error class `errors.BronzeSchemaProbeError(OrchestratorConfigError)` — carries structured `.failures: list[dict]` for programmatic callers.
- ✅ Hook into `orchestrator.run()` at new step 5.6, **after** credential preflight (3.5) + Spark bootstrap (4) + state-table ensure (5) + external-deps preflight (5.5), **before** the main `for node in plan: _execute_node(...)` loop. Failure → exit 2 with no Spark writes.
- ✅ Re-exported `BronzeSchemaProbeError` at package level + `__all__`.
- ✅ 8 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_preflight_bronze_schemas.py`: clean run, skips deferred/silver/gold, schema-not-found classified, credential failure classified, unreachable classified, aggregates all failures (not first-fail), preflight makes zero writes.

**Live evidence**: TC26 narrow probe re-run after the fix lands cleanly on a polluted target table (catalog fix18 shipped together). Closing 21-step happy-path run pending re-dispatch.

**Cross-ref**: surfaced live by `run_id=3f9b0648-181f-4549-952e-8a5b143d4d3b` (TC26 full happy-path, 2026-05-21). Same-session sibling fix18 (catalog SCM→Financial). Follow-up: fix19 (auto-discovery via BICC metadata + bundle-level `schemaOverrides`) — see below.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix18 — Catalog: `po_receipts` + `scm_items` schema "SCM" → "Financial" (shipped 2026-05-21)
**Why**: Data fix — `schema/fusion_catalog.py` declared `schema="SCM"` for both PVOs based on AM-hierarchy heuristic (both live under `FscmTopModelAM.ScmExtractAM.*`). Live TC26 confirmed saasfademo1's BICC only publishes a `"Financial"` offering; the `ScmExtractAM.RcvBiccExtractAM.ReceivingReceiptTransactionExtractPVO` PVO is correctly accessible under `schema="Financial"` (564,752 rows / 459 columns verified). Same for `EgpBiccExtractAM.ItemExtractPVO`.

**Done**:
- ✅ `_ITEM_EXTRACT.schema = "Financial"` (was `"SCM"`)
- ✅ `_PO_RECEIPTS.schema = "Financial"` (was `"SCM"`)
- ✅ Comments on both entries note the schema field is tenant-dependent (P2.22 detection-knob candidate; fix19 follow-up will auto-discover).

**Cross-ref**: fix17 (preflight that surfaced this); fix19 (auto-discovery to remove the need for tenant-by-tenant catalog edits).

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix19 — Auto-discover BICC offering schema + bundle-level `schemaOverrides` (shipped 2026-05-21)

**Done** (3-tier resolution shipped end-to-end with dispatch-contract threading; plan went through 4 reviewer rounds before code landed):

- ✅ `FusionConn.schema_overrides: dict[str, str]` (alias `schemaOverrides`). Keyed by `dataset_id` (customer-facing bundle id), NOT `pvo_id`. Default `{}` — no change for existing bundles.
- ✅ `RunSummary.recommendations: tuple[str, ...]` — threaded from preflight to CLI footer.
- ✅ New `orchestrator/discovery.py` — `discover_pvo_schemas()` hits `/biacm/rest/meta/datastores`, returns `dict[datastore, set[schema]]`. Walker carries schema context via `ancestor_schemas` stack; pairs datastore names with their nearest enclosing schema attribute. Orphan datastores silently skipped to avoid polluting the unique-match count.
- ✅ New `DiscoveryProbeError(OrchestratorConfigError)` — distinct from `BronzeSchemaProbeError`. Discovery-probe HTTP/network failures surface as a modifier on the bronze-schema error.
- ✅ New `PreflightResult(recommendations, effective_schemas)` dataclass. **Dispatch-contract threading** (reviewer round-2 catch): `effective_schemas` threaded into `_execute_node` via keyword-only param; bronze branch passes `schema=effective_schemas[node.dataset_id]` to `extract_pvo`. Without this, override + auto-discovery would have been cosmetic theatre — preflight passes, real dispatch ignores it and crashes with the same error.
- ✅ 3-tier resolution in `preflight_bronze_schemas` (evaluated per PVO, override wins per CLAUDE.md doctrine):
  1. Override (`bundle.fusion.schema_overrides.get(node.dataset_id, …)`) → skip discovery entirely
  2. Catalog default (`pvo.schema`) — fix17's existing path
  3. Auto-discovery on `DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031` — call `discover_pvo_schemas` (memoized per-run); unique → retry + WARN + recommendation; multiple → raise with candidate list; none → raise with PVO-renamed hint
- ✅ Override-failure short-circuit: explicit operator override that fails surfaces directly — never triggers discovery cascading (doctrine: operator typos must be visible).
- ✅ Memoization via closure-scoped `_get_discovery()` cache: N PVOs trip the schema-not-found path → exactly 1 BICC probe call.
- ✅ 5 new `BronzeSchemaProbeError` message branches: `override_failed`, `discovery_ambiguous`, `discovery_not_found`, `discovered_schema_failed`, `schema_infer_then_discovery_failed`. Each names `bundle.fusion.schemaOverrides` as the operator-actionable section.
- ✅ CLI footer in `commands/run.py::_render_summary` renders recommendations after the per-step table; omitted on clean runs.
- ✅ **18 new unit tests** (plan said 16; +2 for basic `PreflightResult` shape + renderer negative-case):
  - 4 discovery (walker against anonymized fixture, orphan skip, inline-schema form, HTTP error)
  - 8 preflight tiers (PreflightResult shape, override skips probe, override-failure no discovery, unique auto-correct with WARN+recommendation+dispatch value, ambiguous candidates, not-found hint, probe-failure fallback, memoization)
  - 1 schema round-trip (`schemaOverrides` parses + survives re-serialize)
  - 3 propagation + dispatch contract (recommendations land in RunSummary; override values reach `extract_pvo(schema=)`; discovered values reach `extract_pvo(schema=)`)
  - 2 CLI renderer (footer present when recommendations non-empty, omitted when empty)
- ✅ Existing fix17 preflight tests updated: stub bundle fixture sets `schema_overrides = {}` (MagicMock auto-truthy would have hijacked every test through the override-tier branch); schema-not-found test mocks `discover_pvo_schemas={}` to route through the new `discovery_not_found` stage.
- ✅ Full unit suite green: **566 passed** (zero existing-test regressions).

**Cross-ref**: builds on P1.5α-fix17 (preflight infrastructure). Replaces the per-tenant catalog-edit pattern P1.5α-fix18 had to do for saasfademo1. Doctrine ref: CLAUDE.md "What varies per tenant — policy vs discovery" — schema name is canonically a discovery problem. Plan-review rounds caught: silver-test coverage gap (round 1), test fixture-hygiene with schema defaults (round 2), suite count math (round 3), the dispatch-threading blocking flaw (round 3), `dataset_id`-vs-`pvo_id` keying (round 4), residual `pvo_id` user-facing references (round 5).

**Live-evidence acceptance** (separate operator dispatch, not part of this PR): saasfademo1 re-dispatch with `schema/fusion_catalog.py` reverted to `schema="SCM"` for `po_receipts`/`scm_items` + NO `schemaOverrides` in bundle → auto-discovery picks `"Financial"` cleanly, footer carries recommendations.

---

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix19 — (was) Auto-discover BICC offering schema + bundle-level `schemaOverrides` (follow-up to fix17)

**Original spec follows (preserved for the rationale + 3-tier design):**

**Why**: Today's flow forces every new customer to **edit the plugin's source** when their tenant's BICC offering structure diverges from the shipped catalog. That violates the CLAUDE.md doctrine — BICC offering schema names are *data-shape discovery*, not *tenant-declared policy*. Customers don't know upfront whether their tenant publishes `po_receipts` under `"Financial"`, `"SCM"`, or `"Supply Chain Management"` — it depends on BICC subscription packages. The plugin must auto-correct or, when it can't, give the customer an in-bundle override that doesn't require touching plugin source.

The fix17 preflight already detects the failure mode cleanly and fails loud. fix19 turns "fail loud" into "self-correct (warn-once) OR escalate to an explicit override". Mirrors the existing detection pattern used by `dim_supplier`'s column-dialect probe (`KNOWN_*_ALIASES`) and matches CLAUDE.md's stated rule: *"Explicit `kwarg=` always wins over detection."*

**Approach** (3-tier resolution, evaluated in order):

1. **Catalog default** (fast path — what fix17 already tries first; no probe cost on the happy path).
2. **Auto-discovery on `DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031`** — on schema-not-found, hit `/biacm/rest/meta/datastores` (the same endpoint `commands/catalog.py::probe` uses), collect all PVOs grouped by offering schema, and search for the catalog's `datastore` name across schemas.
   - **Found in exactly one schema** → retry the inferSchema probe with that schema. On success: log a structured WARN (`"auto-corrected po_receipts: catalog=SCM → discovered=Financial"`), continue with the discovered schema for THIS run, and emit a one-line recommendation in the final RunSummary footer ("consider adding `schemaOverrides.po_receipts: Financial` to bundle.yaml to make this stable across runs").
   - **Found in multiple schemas** → raise `BronzeSchemaProbeError` with the candidate list. Auto-pick is unsafe; customer must choose explicitly via override (tier 3).
   - **Not found anywhere** → raise with hint ("PVO datastore not present on this tenant — catalog drift, PVO renamed, or BICC subscription doesn't include it").
3. **Bundle-level escape hatch** — new optional field on `FusionConn`:
   ```yaml
   fusion:
     serviceUrl: ...
     username: ...
     password: ...
     externalStorage: ...
     schemaOverrides:           # NEW, optional
       po_receipts: Financial
       scm_items: Financial
   ```
   Override always wins over both #1 and #2 (matches CLAUDE.md "explicit kwarg=" rule). Operator-known short-circuit; never triggers the discovery probe.

**Why 3 tiers, not 2** (catalog + override): the auto-discovery tier is the load-bearing piece for portability. Without it, every new customer trips fix17 on first run and has to read the error message + figure out the right override. With it, ~80% of cases self-correct silently (auto-WARN + recommendation), and only the ambiguous "multiple schemas match" case requires customer action.

**Size**: M
- `orchestrator/preflight.py` grows ~80 LOC: on `DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031` catch, call new helper `discover_pvo_schema(bundle.fusion.service_url, bundle.fusion.username, password, pvo.datastore) → str | list[str] | None`. The helper hits `/biacm/rest/meta/datastores` (auth=basic; same shape as `commands/catalog.py::probe`), parses the response, returns the unique schema or candidate list or None.
- `schema/bundle.py` grows ~5 LOC: new `FusionConn.schema_overrides: dict[str, str] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias="schemaOverrides")`.
- `orchestrator/preflight.py` consults `bundle.fusion.schema_overrides.get(pvo.id, pvo.schema)` before the catalog default — override wins.
- `commands/run.py` surfaces the WARN-once recommendation in the operator-facing summary.
- Tests: per-tier unit tests (mock catalog + mock BICC response); end-to-end test that an override skips the probe entirely; live re-dispatch on saasfademo1 with `schemaOverrides` removed proves auto-discovery picks "Financial" cleanly.

**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix17 (preflight infrastructure + failure classification).
**Accept**:
- New `FusionConn.schema_overrides` field with round-trip Pydantic test.
- `preflight_bronze_schemas` consults overrides first, catalog second, auto-discovery third.
- Schema-not-found with unique discovery → run succeeds, WARN logged, RunSummary footer carries the recommendation.
- Schema-not-found with ambiguous discovery → `BronzeSchemaProbeError` listing all candidate schemas.
- Schema-not-found with no discovery → `BronzeSchemaProbeError` with PVO-renamed/removed hint.
- Override explicitly set → no discovery probe; override value used directly.
- Live re-dispatch on saasfademo1 with catalog reverted to `schema="SCM"` + NO override → auto-discovery picks `"Financial"`, run lands cleanly with one WARN per offending PVO.

**Cross-ref**: surfaced as follow-up during fix17/fix18 shipping (2026-05-21); doctrine ref CLAUDE.md "What varies per tenant — policy vs discovery" — schema name is canonically a discovery problem, not policy. P2.22 (deferred-knob backlog) becomes the documentation home for the discovery-vs-policy classification of new fields as they arise.

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix20 — Per-step retry with exponential backoff on transient infra failures (shipped 2026-05-21)
**Why**: TC26 full happy-path re-run (run_id=`da298a83`, 2026-05-21) succeeded on 5/21 steps then hit a transient `Py4JJavaError` at `gl_coa.saveAsTable` after extracting data successfully. Standalone diagnostic re-ran the same call and it succeeded (63,464 rows) — confirming the failure was transient (OCI Object Storage / Spark executor hiccup under load: 11 parallel BICC pulls churning ~14M rows + the 11M-row `gl_period_balances` write at the same time). With `maxRetries: 0`, the orchestrator cascade-aborted 11 downstream nodes and the operator would have to re-run a 25-minute pipeline from scratch. Same shape as today's bug will bite every customer on every tenant under load — and at 25min/iteration, it's the difference between "demo-grade" and "production-grade."

**Done** (Tier 1+2 of the layered fault-tolerance design):
- ✅ New module `orchestrator/retry.py`:
  - `is_transient(exc) → bool` classifier. Inspects: Python exception type (`ConnectionResetError`, `ConnectionRefusedError`, `BrokenPipeError`, `TimeoutError`, etc.), `str(exc)` against transient-pattern list, Py4JJavaError nested `.java_exception.getMessage()` + class name. **Permanent patterns always win** over transient — a message with both "Connection reset" and "AccessDenied" classifies as permanent.
  - `run_with_retry(fn, *, dataset_id, max_retries=3, backoff_base_s=10.0, backoff_factor=3.0, sleep=time.sleep)` helper. Exponential schedule: 10s → 30s → 90s (≤2.2min worst-case extra wall time). Injected `sleep` for testability. Returns `fn()`'s value on first success; re-raises on permanent OR after retries exhausted.
- ✅ Transient pattern list: `Connection reset`, `Read timed out`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `SlowDown`, `RequestTimeout`, `Throttling`, `Temporarily unavailable`, `Executor lost`, `TaskKilled`, `Could not get block locations`, etc.
- ✅ Permanent pattern list: `DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031` (schema not found — fix17 origin), `DELTA_FAILED_TO_MERGE_FIELDS` (fix16 origin), `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `AccessDenied`, `NotAuthorizedOrNotFound`, `AnalysisException`, `MissingDependencyError`, `BundleVersionMismatchError`, `OutOfMemoryError`, etc.
- ✅ Hook into `_execute_node`: bronze branch wraps `extract → enrich → saveAsTable → count` in `run_with_retry`. Silver/Gold branches wrap `node.builder(...)` similarly — `saveAsTable` is the most likely transient and ALL three layers do it.
- ✅ 20 unit tests in `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_retry.py`: classifier coverage (Python builtins + Py4J nested traversal + permanent-wins-over-transient), retry-loop semantics (success first try, transient-then-success, permanent-no-retry, exhaust-retries, zero-retries, mixed transient-then-permanent, injectable backoff).

**Behavior change**:
- **Happy path**: zero overhead. Retry wrapper is a no-op when `fn()` succeeds on attempt 1.
- **Transient hit**: one retry of `gl_coa` after 10s sleep, succeeds, run continues. Today's failure becomes a non-event.
- **Permanent hit**: fails fast with NO retries (preserves fix17's preflight semantics + cascade contract).
- **Persistent transient**: 4 attempts (1 + 3 retries) with 10s + 30s + 90s sleep → 2.2min worst-case extra time → fails with same `repr(exc)` as before. Cascade still triggers correctly.

**Live evidence**: pending re-dispatch of TC26 full happy-path after fix20 ships. Expected: gl_coa-class transients become invisible to operators; only persistent failures (e.g., a 5-minute BICC outage) escape to the cascade path.

**Cross-ref**: surfaced live by `run_id=da298a83-f9d5-4d94-bbb2-5c9f626cad0a` (TC26 full happy-path, 2026-05-21); fix17 (preflight that classifies permanent BICC config bugs — the retry classifier deliberately overlaps with fix17's permanent set). Follow-up: fix21 (Tier 3 + Tier 4 — resume from checkpoint + chaos test).

### `[x]` P1.5α-fix21 — Resume from checkpoint + chaos-test the retry classifier (follow-up to fix20) — **CLOSED 2026-06-02 (TC27 re-validation on new pod / new BICC user). Original 2026-05-23 evidence + 2026-06-02 re-validation in `tests/live/TC27_resume_from_checkpoint_results.md`.**

**Implementation status (2026-05-23)**: Tier 3 + Tier 4 shipped on `oussama-dev-fix21-resume-from-checkpoint`. 624 tests green (566 pre-fix21 + 58 new). Live TC27 evidence template in `tests/live/TC27_resume_from_checkpoint_results.md` — needs operator dispatch on `fusion_bundle_dev` to populate. Once TC27 fills in, this entry strikes through with PR link + shipped date.

Key implementation decisions ratified during multi-round plan review:

  * Identity hash includes 8 fields (added `fusion.username` after review #4): `fusion.{serviceUrl, externalStorage, username}`, `aidp.{catalog, bronzeSchema, silverSchema, goldSchema}`, `plugin_version`. Secrets explicitly excluded.
  * `plan_snapshot` shape: `{"identity": {...}, "nodes": [...]}` persisted alongside `plan_hash`. Both required for resumability — `read_resumable_state` rejects partial-metadata rows up-front (no degraded path). See `ResumeRunNotResumableError` subcases 1 + 2.
  * Original `run_id` preserved on resume — load-bearing for the CLAUDE.md medallion `<layer>_run_id` invariant. Trade-off: state-table becomes multi-row-per-`(run_id, dataset_id)` on resume. Mitigation: `fusion_bundle_state_latest` Delta VIEW created by `ensure_state_table` projects one-row-per-pair via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY run_id, dataset_id ORDER BY last_run_at DESC)`. Documented in LIMITS.md §L-Resume.
  * `ResumeContext.succeeded` includes BOTH `'success'` AND `'resumed_skipped'` so a re-resume of an already-resumed run treats carry-forwards as done.
  * Preflight narrowing: `preflight_bronze_schemas` only probes un-succeeded bronze; succeeded schemas pulled from `plan_snapshot`. Avoids ~5-min/PVO BICC re-probe + transient-failure risk on previously-good nodes.
  * External-dep preflight on resume includes succeeded-node tables that reattempt-plan nodes read from (`compute_reattempt_extra_deps`). Catches manually-dropped upstream bronze BEFORE downstream-only reattempt dispatches.

### `[ ]` P1.5α-fix21 — Resume from checkpoint + chaos-test the retry classifier (follow-up to fix20) — (original entry below for reference)
**Why**: fix20's retry handles transient hiccups that resolve in seconds (2.2min worst case). It does NOT help when:
- Retries exhaust on a genuinely flaky upstream (e.g. a 5-minute BICC outage that exceeds 130s of cumulative backoff).
- The customer Ctrl-Cs a run halfway through, or the cluster auto-terminates after `autoTerminationMinutes`.
- A permanent config bug (caught by fix17 preflight OR fix20's permanent classifier) fails the run after 9 successful bronze pulls — the operator has to re-run those 9 pulls from scratch.

For a 25-minute pipeline with ~14M row-writes in flight, "re-run from scratch" is a real customer-facing reliability problem. fix21 solves it.

**Approach** (Tier 3 + Tier 4 of the layered fault-tolerance design):

**Tier 3 — Resume from checkpoint** (M, ~200 LOC + new CLI flag):
- New `aidp-fusion-bundle run --resume <run_id>` flag.
- At orchestrator start, if `--resume` is set: query `fusion_bundle_state` for that run_id. Build a `resumed_from` set of (`dataset_id`) where `status='success'`. Skip those nodes in the dispatch loop — their bronze/silver/gold tables already have the right rows on disk, no re-fetch needed.
- Re-attempt nodes with `status='failed'` / `'skipped'` (cascade) / `'skipped'` (aborted). NEW state-table rows are written WITH THE ORIGINAL `run_id` — the row count for any successful resumed step UPSERTs the prior row's metadata.
- `--resume` semantics: skip-by-state, NOT skip-by-existence. A customer who manually dropped `fusion_catalog.bronze.gl_coa` between runs gets it re-extracted; the state table is the source of truth.
- Edge cases: resuming a run whose bundle has since changed (different datasets, different schema) must raise a clear error rather than silently mixing schemas. Probably enforced by hashing the bundle's resolved plan into the state-table.

**Tier 4 — Chaos test the retry classifier** (S, ~80 LOC):
- New `tests/integration/test_retry_chaos.py` (or unit-level if we can stub the cluster).
- Injects randomized transient + permanent failures into N% of saveAsTable / extract calls via monkeypatch.
- Asserts: transient → retried → eventual success; permanent → not retried → fast failure; cascade still fires when all retries exhausted; state-table rows are consistent.
- Without this, fix20's classifier is a list of patterns that might rot — the chaos test pins down the contract empirically.

**Size**: M+S = ~half a day's work, deserves its own PR (Tier 3 alone is bigger than fix17+fix18+fix20 combined).

**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix20 (transient classifier provides the permanent/transient distinction that resume needs to know whether to retry-or-resume-or-bail).

**Accept**:
- `--resume <run_id>` skips `status='success'` nodes; re-attempts the rest.
- Bundle-drift between resume runs raises a clear `ResumeBundleMismatchError`.
- State-table row count after resume equals what a clean run would have produced (verified end-to-end on saasfademo1).
- Chaos test injects ≥5% failure rate across N=100 simulated runs; assertions hold for transient/permanent/cascade contracts.
- Live evidence (TC27 or extension to TC26 doc): a deliberate kill-mid-run + `--resume` produces a complete pipeline in (resume time) ≪ (clean run time).

**Cross-ref**: fix20 (the retry classifier this builds on); TC26 cost data (25min/run + ~14M row writes lost on transient = strong motivation for resume).


### `[ ]` P1.5δ — Claude-Code-driven MCP dispatch slash command — **reassess after P1.5ε**
**Status note (2026-05-15)**: Original justification was that surface #3 (laptop terminal → REST) was blocked upstream, leaving MCP as the only way for Claude Code users to dispatch. That premise broke when the `aiwap` REST API shipped 2026-04-30 (see P1.5ε). Once P1.5ε lands and TC28 confirms OCI signing works, Claude Code users can just shell out to `aidp-fusion-bundle run --mode seed` — no slash command, no MCP, no second dispatch path to maintain. **Decision deferred**: keep this entry alive but do not start work. After P1.5ε ships, choose one of: (a) **cancel** P1.5δ if REST works cleanly for Claude Code users with `~/.oci/config` set up; (b) **keep** P1.5δ if REST's auth-setup friction or batch-only semantics (no live kernel for interactive bundle debugging) make it the wrong fit for Claude-Code-driven exploration. Default expectation today: lean toward cancellation — REST is the cleaner primitive and one dispatch path beats two.

**Why (original)**: P1.5α ships `--inline` as the architectural primary — works from inside an AIDP notebook session. But the CLAUDE.md "CLI is the contract" goal includes a second customer journey: **customer with Claude Code installed on their laptop** wants to type `/aidp-fusion-bundle run --mode seed` and have the bundle materialize without opening a browser or AIDP notebook by hand. The MCP-based dispatch primitive exists today — `oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-spark-connectors/tools/live_test_driver.py` documents the canonical flow: `mcp__aidp__nb_save_file` → `mcp__aidp__nb_create_session` → `mcp__aidp__nb_execute_code` against a chosen cluster, with stdout captured between `AIDP_LIVE_TEST_RESULT_BEGIN/END` markers. This is **us-implementable** (no upstream gap); we just need to wrap the pattern as a slash command + companion skill on the fusion-bundle's existing Claude Code plugin surface (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` already exists; `skills/aidp-fusion-bundle/` is the namespace).

Intentionally separated from P1.5α: TC27 (live MCP-dispatch evidence) needs a working Claude Code MCP session against `fusion_bundle_dev`; if that integration surfaces issues, P1.5α's `--inline` correctness (TC26) shouldn't get held hostage. Ship the foundation, then build the convenience layer on top.

**Size**: M — slash command file (`.claude-plugin/commands/run.md`) + companion skill (`skills/aidp-fusion-bundle/SKILL.md` extended with the dispatch flow) + a small `AIDP_LIVE_TEST_RESULT_BEGIN/END` marker emitter added to `_render_summary` so the captured stdout has parseable RunSummary JSON. ~3-4h plus live verification.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped (slash command uploads `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb`, which P1.5α produces). Modeled directly on `oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-spark-connectors/tools/live_test_driver.py` — same pattern, production use instead of test-harness use.
**Accept**:
- `.claude-plugin/commands/run.md` slash command: takes `--mode`, `--datasets`, `--cluster` (default `fusion_bundle_dev`); orchestrates the MCP flow.
- Companion skill: documents the per-step MCP calls so the skill is runnable end-to-end as a Claude Code agent flow (upload `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb` + `bundle.yaml` → create session → execute cells → parse markers → render the RunSummary inline).
- `_render_summary` emits the parseable JSON envelope between `AIDP_LIVE_TEST_RESULT_BEGIN` / `_END` markers (one extra `console.print(...)` in P1.5δ scope, ~10 LOC).
- Live evidence: **TC27** captures one full dispatch on `fusion_bundle_dev` — slash command runs, MCP tools dispatch to AIDP, RunSummary JSON parsed, all 11 bronze + 3+2 silver + 3+2 gold rows verified in `fusion_bundle_state` post-run.
- Failure-mode tests: MCP session unavailable → clear error; cluster name invalid → clear error; notebook execution timeout → clear error with timeout configuration hint.

### `[ ]` P1.5ε — Laptop-terminal REST dispatch (formerly P3.13 advocacy; REST API shipped 2026-04-30)

**Status (2026-05-17)**: **Empirical probe complete end-to-end against `amitV2` / `playground` / `fusion_bundle_dev`.** All four phases of the §11 retry checklist pass (auth, upload, job submission, fetchOutput). Auth model CONFIRMED as OCI request signing — the §395 "load-bearing prerequisite" is satisfied. All implementer-facing schema corrections live in the internal REST-probe notes — read those notes as the source of truth for client code, NOT the `Schema facts` block below (some of which has been empirically falsified — see notes inline). Implementable now; gated only on P1.5α shipping the orchestrator notebook.

**Why**: Surface 3 of the three execution surfaces for `aidp-fusion-bundle run` — a bare laptop terminal, no Claude Code, no notebook session (CI / cron / scripts) — was thought to be blocked upstream. As of the 2026-04-30 `aiwap` REST release (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/ai-data-platform/aiwap/rest-endpoints.html, OpenAPI at `aiwap/swagger.json`), it's implementable. Public model is the **Workflow `jobs`/`jobRuns` job-submission pattern**, not a kernel-execute channel (the `sessions` endpoints carry metadata only — no public `/execute`). The three customer journeys for `aidp-fusion-bundle run` become:
1. ✅ From inside an AIDP notebook session: `--inline` works (P1.5α).
2. ✅ From Claude Code on a laptop: MCP-based dispatch (P1.5δ).
3. 🟡 From a bare laptop terminal: REST dispatch (this item).

**Why P1.5ε, not P1.5α**: P1.5α (`--inline`) is the architectural primary because the orchestrator needs Spark + checkpointer + `aidputils.secrets` + Delta catalog — all notebook-runtime objects. REST dispatch is a wrapper that uploads `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb` to AIDP and submits it as a job; it depends on the notebook existing and being final, which is a P1.5α deliverable. Ship α first, ε after.

**Schema facts** (captured from `aiwap/swagger.json` so the implementer doesn't re-derive):
- **Path prefix**: `/20260430/aiDataPlatforms/{aiDataPlatformId}/workspaces/{workspaceKey}/...`
- **Flow**: `POST .../notebook/api/contents/{path}` (upload `.ipynb`) → `POST .../jobs` (create job; one `tasks[]` entry of `type: NOTEBOOK_TASK`) → `POST .../jobRuns` (submit; `{jobKey, parameters[], queue}`) → poll `GET .../jobRuns/{key}` for `state.status` ∈ `{PENDING, QUEUED, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED, CANCELED, TIMED_OUT}` → `POST .../taskRuns/{taskRunKey}/actions/fetchOutput {outputKey}` for the RunSummary.
- **`NotebookTask`**: `notebookPath: string` (required), `cluster: JobCluster` (required), `source: WORKSPACE | GIT_PROVIDER` (default `WORKSPACE`), `parameters: array<{name, value}>` (**not a map** — both fields string-typed), `timeoutSeconds`, `isStreaming`. **`SPARK_SUBMIT_TASK` is in the `Task.type` enum but has no schema definition — treat as reserved.**
- **`JobCluster`**: `clusterKey` (task-local nickname, **not a global cluster OCID**) + `newCluster: NewClusterConfiguration`. Existing-cluster reuse happens at the **job** level via `jobClusters[]` (referenced by `clusterKey`); there is no `existingClusterId` field on the task.
- **Output** *(empirically corrected 2026-05-17 — see probe doc §10.4–§10.6)*: `fetchOutput` requires body `{"outputKey": ""}` (empty string, **not** `"main"` as initially assumed). Response shape is `data[].type` + `data[].**value**` (NOT `content`). Only the `NOTEBOOK` type was observed; other enum values speculated here were not seen in practice. **`oidlUtils.notebook.exit()` is NOT a reliable surfacing primitive** — on the probed cluster the module was unavailable and the call raised. **The stdout-marker pattern (`AIDP_LIVE_TEST_RESULT_BEGIN/END`) is the cross-cluster-reliable channel**: the marker line surfaces inside the executed notebook's `cells[*].outputs[*].data["text/plain"]` strings, returned in `data[0].value`. Implementer: keep the dual-channel pattern (`try: notebook.exit(...); except: print(marker)`) and parse the embedded notebook on the REST side — see probe doc §10.8 for the final primitive signatures.
- **Auth** *(empirically CONFIRMED 2026-05-17)*: OCI request signing works against the data-plane endpoints. One signed `GET /workspaces` returned 200 with valid JSON; the full round-trip (upload → create job → submit run → poll → fetchOutput) completed cleanly using `oci.signer.Signer` (here via `oci raw-request` for the probe; production code uses `requests` with `auth=signer`). Data-plane endpoints under `/workspaces/{wk}/...` are still **not wrapped by the OCI Python SDK** — `AiDataPlatformClient` exposes control-plane methods only.
- **`datalake-tenant-id` header**: required only on `/notebook/api/sessions` and `/notebook/api/contents/{contentPath}` (the Jupyter passthrough); **not on `/jobs`, `/jobRuns`, or `fetchOutput`**. Origin of the value is undocumented; if the upload step needs it, probe.

**Implementation sketch**:
- Build an `aidp_rest` client module: `requests` with `auth=oci.signer.Signer(...)`, or alternatively shell out to `oci raw-request` (CLI does the signing). Resource-principal / instance-principal signers when running in-cloud.
- New file: `scripts/.../dispatch/aidp_rest.py` — `upload_notebook(path) → workspace_path`, `create_job(notebook_path, cluster_ref) → job_key`, `submit_run(job_key, parameters) → run_key`, `poll_run(run_key) → terminal_status`, `fetch_output(task_run_key) → RunSummary`.
- `commands/run.py:_run_via_aidp_dispatch()` becomes a real implementation that threads `bundle_path` + cluster reference from `aidp-deploy.config.json`.
- Add `notebook.exit(json.dumps(summary.to_dict()))` cell to `notebooks/run_orchestrator.ipynb` (1 LOC + 1 import).

**Size**: S–M (~½ to 1 day, down from M). Auth empirical work is DONE (probe doc); lion's share is now just the `aidp_rest` client wrapper.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped (notebook + orchestrator exist). The empirical-probe prerequisite is **satisfied** (see Status note above).
**Accept**:
- ~~Empirical evidence file `tests/live/TC28_rest_auth_probe.md` showing a signed request to AIDP returning 200 (not 401/403).~~ **Satisfied 2026-05-17** — evidence captured in the internal REST-probe notes §10.
- `aidp-fusion-bundle run --mode seed` (no `--inline`) against `fusion_bundle_dev` from a laptop terminal returns exit code 0 and prints the RunSummary. Live evidence at `tests/live/TC29_rest_dispatch.md`.
- Unit tests cover the four `aidp_rest` primitives with `responses`-mocked HTTP. Use the response shapes from probe doc §10 as fixture data (not the speculative shapes from this entry's pre-2026-05-17 schema-facts block).
- `_run_via_aidp_dispatch()` error message removed (function does real work now).
- Client-side validates body shape **before** sending `POST /jobs` (mandatory fields per probe doc §10.1: `name`, `path`, `maxConcurrentRuns`, plus task-level requirements). One malformed request trips the workflow CircuitBreaker for ~15 min — defense-in-depth here is load-bearing.

**File upstream issue if blocked**: if OCI signing turns out NOT to be the right scheme, OR if `datalake-tenant-id` is required on `/notebook/api/contents` and the origin is non-discoverable, file an issue with the AIDP team to get the auth-and-headers spec published in the `aiwap` doc tree (current gap: `swagger.json` has empty `securityDefinitions`).

### `[ ]` P1.Xb — Schema preflight before `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` *(orchestrator-evolution design item A — elevate to ship-with-α candidate)*
**Why**: Today each mart module validates its own kwargs and (in ap_aging's case) hard-gates on the currency column. But required bronze / silver column existence isn't checked uniformly — a missing column failures inside Spark with a cryptic `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN` analysis error. A unified preflight that runs before `spark.sql(CREATE OR REPLACE)` gives customers a clear, actionable error. Single biggest "Fusion release breaks us" insurance policy — DESIGN doc §2 argues for elevating to α-mandatory.
**Size**: S — one helper (`preflight_required_columns(spark, table, required_cols) → None | raise`), invoked from each mart's `build()` after kwarg validation and before SQL execution. Per-mart required-column lists tied to the post-detect kwargs (e.g. `ap_aging` requires `ApInvoicesVendorId`, `ApInvoicesInvoiceDate`, `ApInvoicesInvoiceAmount`, `ApInvoicesAmountPaid`, the detected currency col, and the detected/configured cancelled + terms-date cols).
**Accept**: every shipped mart's `build()` raises a `MartPreflightError` (or similar) listing the missing column(s) by name when bronze/silver schema doesn't match expectations; unit-tested via the same fake-Spark stub pattern used for `detect_*_params` tests; ap_aging's existing currency-presence hard-gate is folded into this preflight so the contract is uniform.

## Theme: Medallion performance & incrementality (round-6 perf audit, 2026-05-11)

### `[x]` P1.17 — Switch dims + gold marts from `CREATE OR REPLACE` to `MERGE INTO` with watermark gate (Stage A/B docs `<plan-only>`, Stage C `5f644d7`, Stage D `f6d003a`, Stage E `76fec96`; live evidence `TC22b_TC23b_TC24b_p117_seed_regression.md` + `TC30a_p117_incremental_merge_proof.md` + `TC_E4_xxhash_surrogate_stability.md`)
**Why**: Every silver/gold module emits `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE … USING DELTA AS SELECT …` (`dim_account.py:223`, `dim_supplier.py:64`, `transforms/gold/supplier_spend.py:100`, `transforms/gold/gl_balance.py:248`, `transforms/gold/ap_aging.py:428`). That's a full table rewrite every refresh — the **medallion-architecture concept break**: bronze is supposed to grow incrementally, silver/gold MERGE on changed slices, but today a daily refresh of `gold.gl_balance` rewrites all 11M rows. On a tenant with 5 years of GL history (~50M rows projected), daily incremental refresh costs the same as the seed load. Same problem applies to `supplier_spend` and `ap_aging`. Cascades into three already-noted side-effects: `monotonically_increasing_id()` surrogate keys are unstable (P1.19); window-function dedupe sorts the full bronze every rebuild (`dim_account.py:243-252`, `dim_supplier.py:87-94`); `ap_aging` double-scans `bronze.ap_invoices` (P2.20). Fix the root, the rest fall out.
**Size**: L — six modules + watermark-write contract + live re-verification of TC22 / TC23 / TC24 incremental shape.
**Depends on**: P1.5 (orchestrator) — MERGE needs the orchestrator to advance the watermark in `fusion_bundle_state` after each successful build. Building MERGE logic on top of a not-yet-wired dispatch path is wasted work. **P1.5β.1 (state-contract infrastructure) shipped**: `read_last_watermark` real, `_resolve_watermark_source` resolver, `RunStep.last_watermark`, bronze closure captures `extract_started_at - WATERMARK_SAFETY_WINDOW`, `WatermarkMonotonicityError` + check, tuple-keyed resume carry-forward — all unit-tested. P1.17 owns: removing the `NotImplementedError` gate at `__init__.py:641-645`, threading `prior_watermark` into `extract_pvo(watermark=...)` at `__init__.py:393`, non-destructive bronze/silver/gold write strategy (MERGE), silver/gold lineage column + capture, `bundle.yaml` `incremental.watermark_safety_window_seconds` override, README update, end-to-end live evidence with delta-only extract.
**Accept**:
- Each `build()` accepts `refresh_mode: Literal["seed", "incremental"]`. `"seed"` keeps the existing `CREATE OR REPLACE` shape (first run, full backfill). `"incremental"` emits `MERGE INTO target USING (… filtered by _extract_ts > last_watermark …) ON target.<natural_key> = src.<natural_key> WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET * WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *`.
- Watermark is read from + written to `fusion_bundle_state` by the orchestrator only — mart modules stay stateless.
- `dim_calendar` is exempt — fully deterministic, no source watermark; stays on `CREATE OR REPLACE`.
- Live evidence: TC22b / TC23b / TC24b — same tenant, two consecutive runs with synthetic mid-extract delta; assert second run touches only delta rows (Delta-table version diff or `OPTIMIZE`-side stats).

### `[ ]` P1.18 — Partition + Z-ORDER bronze + silver + gold tables
**Why**: None of the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE … USING DELTA` statements declare `PARTITIONED BY` or run `OPTIMIZE … ZORDER BY`. OAC dashboards filtering `gold.gl_balance` by `period_year` or `currency_code` do full-table scans every query — on 11M rows + future history that's a 1s tile vs a 30s tile. Bronze `gl_period_balances` (11M rows today on `fusion_bundle_dev`) isn't partitioned either, so even gold-side `WHERE BalanceActualFlag = 'A'` filters scan every file. Delta data-skipping helps but only on the first ~32 columns; explicit Z-ORDER on dashboard-filter columns is order-of-magnitude better.
**Size**: M — pure DDL changes to the `CREATE TABLE` SQL each module emits + optional post-MERGE `OPTIMIZE ZORDER BY` runs. No logic changes.
**Depends on**: nothing — independent of P1.17 (partitioning works under both `CREATE OR REPLACE` and `MERGE`). Ships now as a quick win.
**Accept**:
- `bronze.gl_period_balances`: `PARTITIONED BY (BalancePeriodYear)`.
- `bronze.ap_invoices`: `PARTITIONED BY (_extract_date)` (computed audit column; supports incremental MERGE in P1.17).
- `gold.gl_balance`: `PARTITIONED BY (period_year)` + `OPTIMIZE … ZORDER BY (currency_code, ledger_id, account_id)`.
- `gold.ap_aging` / `gold.ap_outstanding_by_invoice_age` / `gold.supplier_spend`: no partition (small relative to balance fact) but `OPTIMIZE … ZORDER BY (currency_code, vendor_id)`.
- `dim_account`, `dim_supplier`, `dim_calendar`: no partitioning (tiny; broadcast-joinable as-is).
- Live evidence: re-run TC23 (gl_balance) and TC24 (ap_aging) with `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` captured pre + post, showing partition-pruning + data-skipping firing for a `WHERE period_year = 2025 AND currency_code = 'USD'`-style filter.

### `[x]` P1.19 — Replace `monotonically_increasing_id()` with `xxhash64(natural_key)` for surrogate keys (bundled with P1.17 Stage C `5f644d7`; live evidence `TC_E4_xxhash_surrogate_stability.md` — 209/209 supplier_key pairs match byte-for-byte across two builds)
**Why**: `dim_account.account_key` (`dim_account.py:227`) and `dim_supplier.supplier_key` (`dim_supplier.py:68`) both use `monotonically_increasing_id()`. Partition-local, non-deterministic across rebuilds — documented in the module docstrings as "downstream marts MUST join on the natural key, never on the surrogate". Fine under today's full-rebuild pattern, but breaks under P1.17's incremental MERGE (a row's surrogate would change every refresh, invalidating any downstream cache keyed on it). Same blocker for any future Type-2 SCD variant. `dim_supplier`'s docstring already names the upgrade: `xxhash64(natural_key)`. Apply to `dim_account` (`xxhash64(CAST(CodeCombinationCodeCombinationId AS STRING))`) too.
**Size**: S — one SQL expression per dim + a unit test asserting stability across two builds of the same bronze snapshot.
**Depends on**: nothing for the change itself; logically pairs with P1.17 — ship together so MERGE's correctness story includes stable surrogates.
**Accept**:
- `dim_account.account_key = xxhash64(CAST(CodeCombinationCodeCombinationId AS STRING))`.
- `dim_supplier.supplier_key = xxhash64(SEGMENT1)`.
- Unit test: build the same dim twice from a fixed bronze snapshot; assert every surrogate value matches.
- Docstring updated in both modules to drop the "non-stable across rebuilds" caveat.

### `[x]` P1.17c — Dropped-target preflight (silent-corruption guard for incremental mode)
**Why**: P1.17 V1's preflight checked silver/gold cursor presence via `IncrementalCursorMissingError` but NOT target-table existence vs cursor presence. If an operator dropped a target table while `fusion_bundle_state` still carried a non-NULL `last_watermark`, the next incremental run silently: (1) CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS auto-created the empty target per B6c, (2) MERGE inserted only the delta rows (BICC filter with `prior_cursor` excluded everything older), (3) the full history below `prior_cursor` was permanently gone — operator didn't notice until they queried historical data. This was documented as **LIMITS.md P1.17-L5** with interim operator discipline (clear the state row before dropping). P1.17c resolves the highest-blast-radius P1.17 follow-up by enforcing the check at run-level preflight.
**Size**: S (~1 day) — extend `_preflight_incremental_cursors` in `orchestrator/preflight.py` with a target-existence check; add `IncrementalTargetMissingError` (inherits `OrchestratorConfigError` for CLI exit-2); restore the deferred `D-target-dropped` unit test.
**Depends on**: P1.17 (shipped — `5f644d7`).
**Resolved in**: P1.17c (PR #13, 2026-06-02). `LIMITS.md` is intentionally gitignored as a local/private limit registry, so this tracked backlog entry is the reviewable resolution record for P1.17-L5.
**Accept**:
- ✅ `_preflight_incremental_cursors` raises `IncrementalTargetMissingError` when any plan node has a non-NULL `last_watermark` in state but the target Delta table doesn't exist.
- ✅ Error message names every affected `(dataset_id, layer, target)` + remediation (clear state row + re-run seed) per the P1.17-L5 recovery sequence.
- ✅ Unit test: mock `spark.catalog.tableExists → False` + state-row has non-NULL `last_watermark` → preflight raises before any `_execute_node` call.
- ✅ P1.17-L5 is resolved in the tracked backlog record; local `LIMITS.md` carries the same resolved note but remains ignored by design.

### `[ ]` P1.17a + P1.17b — Aggregate-mart incremental MERGE + dim-delta UNION (`supplier_spend` + `gl_balance`-dim-only)
**Why**: V1 marks `supplier_spend.incremental_capable=False` per LIMITS.md **P1.17-L4** because its 6-column GROUP BY grain mixes a mutable fact attribute (`approval_status`) — partial-MERGE leaves both PENDING and APPROVED aggregate rows on a status flip. AND V1's `gl_balance` row-level MERGE doesn't refresh denormalized dim attributes on dim-only changes per LIMITS.md **P1.17-L3** — operator scheduled `--mode seed` weekly is the interim catch-up. Both gaps share the same SQL surface (the gold-mart renderer with affected-keys + recompute CTEs) — bundle as one PR per plan §"Out of Scope" + §"When to file these tickets" (bullet 2).
**Size**: M (~2 days). Five components must ship together for correctness:
- `merge_key_columns` + `slice_key_columns` fields on `GoldMartSpec`.
- `fact_delta_keys` + `dim_<dim>_delta_keys` UNION CTE (covers dim-only refresh case from P1.17a too).
- `recomputed` CTE with `JOIN affected_slices`.
- MERGE on `merge_key` with explicit UPDATE column list.
- Follow-up `DELETE` for orphan grain rows (handles `approval_status` flip).
**Depends on**: P1.17 (shipped — `5f644d7`).
**Accept**:
- `supplier_spend.incremental_capable` flipped to `True`.
- `gl_balance` MERGE source predicate adds `UNION (dim-side delta-mapped-to-fact-grain)` so dim-only changes refresh `gl_balance`'s denormalized hierarchy columns.
- Restored D-aggregate-merge-correctness + D-dim-rename-no-orphan + D-fact-grain-move + D-dim-only-a/b/c tests pin the SQL contract.
- Live evidence: vendor V1 with 3 invoices (100/200/300); inject delta `I2.amount=250`; assert post-incremental `supplier_spend.V1.total_spend == 650` (NOT 700 from leftover old row); `DESCRIBE HISTORY` shows a MERGE commit (not CREATE OR REPLACE).
- LIMITS.md P1.17-L3 + P1.17-L4 moved to §Resolved.

### `[x]` P1.17e — Bronze MERGE payload-diff predicate (downstream cost optimization) — **SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (branch `oussama-dev-p1.17e-bronze-merge-payload-diff`, PR #14 merged); LIMITS §P1.17-L7 moved to §Resolved. Live evidence partially executed in `tests/live/TC30b_p117e_payload_diff_results.md`: bronze.gl_coa Run-B MERGE shows `numTargetRowsUpdated=0` against `numSourceRows=63,464` — definitive P1.17e proof on real Delta. `gl_period_balances` failed extract-side (unrelated BICC Py4JJavaError, same class as TC26 2026-05-21's po_receipts case) so downstream silver/gold cutoff is deferred to a follow-up run; the primary contract is already proven by gl_coa.**
**Why**: V1's bronze MERGE uses unconditional `WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *` — rewrites every matched row's `_extract_ts` on every cycle. For PVOs flagged `incremental_capable=False` (full re-extract every cycle — `gl_period_balances`, `gl_coa`, `ap_aging_periods`), this means downstream silver/gold's `WHERE bronze_extract_ts > prior_silver_watermark` predicate matches every row → downstream MERGE runs on every cycle even when nothing materially changed. Documented as **LIMITS.md P1.17-L7**; cost ≈ silver/gold seed-mode cost on every incremental cycle for the affected chain (`dim_account` + `gl_balance`). Cost optimization NOT correctness — produces correct results, just wasted compute. Plan ranks this as bullet 3 in the sequencing recommendation — "quick win once metrics confirm the cost hit is real."
**Size**: S (~1 day) — `WHEN MATCHED AND (target.<col> IS DISTINCT FROM src.<col> OR ...) THEN UPDATE SET *` predicate generated from the bronze schema (excluding audit columns).
**Depends on**: P1.17 (shipped — `5f644d7`).
**Accept**:
- Bronze MERGE SQL emits `IS DISTINCT FROM`-gated UPDATE clause over data columns (excluding `_extract_ts`, `_source_pvo`, `_run_id`, `_watermark_used`).
- Restored D-payload-diff + D-no-op-reextract unit tests.
- Live evidence: incremental run on `gl_period_balances` after a no-change bronze cycle → `DESCRIBE HISTORY gold.gl_balance` shows NO new MERGE commit (matched-but-no-payload-change path didn't propagate).
- LIMITS.md P1.17-L7 moved to §Resolved.

### `[x]` P1.17d — Schema evolution under MERGE (ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS helper) — **SHIPPED 2026-06-02 / 2026-06-03 (branch `oussama-dev-p1.17d-schema-evolution`, PR #15); LIMITS §P1.17-L6 moved to §Resolved. 22 new unit tests (helper-7, dispatch-runtime-4, builder-SQL-shape-3, validation-order-4, import-graph-4) + live evidence in `tests/live/TC30c_p117d_schema_evolution_results.md`: all 3 phases EXECUTED (Phase A seed baseline, Phase B source-wider auto-ALTER, Phase C target-wider explicit-column-list MERGE) + strict Phase C rerun with dynamically-selected real Segment1 values proves sentinel-value preservation (3 sentinel-backfilled rows survive the MERGE intact).**
**Why**: V1's bronze MERGE assumes the target's schema matches the source DataFrame's schema exactly. If BICC adds a column to a PVO between cycles, the MERGE fails with a Spark `AnalysisException` naming the new column. Documented as **LIMITS.md P1.17-L6**; interim mitigation is manual `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS` + re-run. Plan ranks this as bullet 4 in the sequencing recommendation — "pair with the next BICC drift incident; not urgent until a real schema change hits." Pairs naturally with BACKLOG L1 (BICC schema drift) / P2.16 (drift-detection tooling).
**Size**: M (~2 days) — `_ensure_target_schema_for_merge(spark, target, source_schema)` helper + call site in `_do_bronze` incremental branch + each silver/gold incremental branch + 3 sub-cases of D-schema test (source-wider, target-wider, type-conflict).
**Depends on**: P1.17 (shipped — `5f644d7`).
**Accept**:
- `_ensure_target_schema_for_merge` DESCRIBE-TABLEs the target, computes the source∖target diff, emits `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS (<diff>)` for source-wider cases.
- Explicit column-list MERGE syntax for target-wider cases (target has extra columns source lacks — INSERT * would fail).
- Restored D-schema-a/b/c unit tests.
- Live evidence: simulate BICC adding a column to `bronze.ap_invoices` between Run A and Run B; Run B succeeds without operator intervention; new column populated for delta rows, NULL for prior rows.
- LIMITS.md P1.17-L6 moved to §Resolved.

### `[ ]` P1.20 — Implement Type-2 SCD on dim tables (`dim_supplier`, `dim_account`)
**Why**: Today's dims overwrite on every rebuild — no history. A supplier's name change, a payment-terms revision, a COA account re-mapping, all silently mutate dim rows in place. Downstream marts joining on the natural key see "as-of-now" only; historical fact rows lose their original dim context (the GL balance from FY23 joins to the *current* account hierarchy, not the FY23 one). SOX trail and any "what did this look like at period close" question are unanswerable. Named as a future blocker in P1.17 and P1.19 but never tracked as its own deliverable. Reference shape exists at `oracle-aidp-samples/data-engineering/transformation/scd/slowly_changing_dimension_template.ipynb` — Jinja2-templated two-step MERGE+INSERT (expire matched-but-differing current row, then insert new version). Needs adaptation: replace `current_date()` with the orchestrator's run timestamp, add `xxhash64(natural_key || effective_start_date)` surrogate for the *version key* (separate from the natural-key surrogate from P1.19), wire `_extract_ts` / `_run_id` audit columns, templatize the PK (the sample hardcodes `customer_id`).
**Size**: M — two dims × (DDL with `effective_start_date`, `effective_end_date`, `is_current` + two-step MERGE+INSERT + tracked-cols list + SQL-shape unit test + live evidence under TC25 / TC26 showing a tracked-col change produces two rows for the same natural key).
**Depends on**: P1.17 (incremental MERGE foundation) and P1.19 (deterministic surrogates) — ship after both so the Type-2 version key is `xxhash64(natural_key || effective_start_date)` and the MERGE machinery already exists.
**Accept**:
- `dim_supplier` and `dim_account` carry `effective_start_date TIMESTAMP`, `effective_end_date TIMESTAMP` (NULL for current), `is_current BOOLEAN`, `version_key BIGINT` (= `xxhash64(natural_key || CAST(effective_start_date AS STRING))`).
- Tracked-columns list per dim is explicit at the top of the module (e.g. `dim_supplier`: `supplier_name`, `business_relationship`, `pay_group`; `dim_account`: segment value descriptions).
- Two-step pattern: (a) `MERGE INTO dim USING src ON dim.natural_key = src.natural_key AND dim.is_current = true WHEN MATCHED AND (any-tracked-col differs) THEN UPDATE SET is_current = false, effective_end_date = :run_ts`; (b) `INSERT` new versions where natural key is new OR any tracked col differs from current.
- Downstream marts unchanged — they continue to join on the natural-key surrogate from P1.19, which is stable across versions. Point-in-time joins (fact's `_extract_ts` BETWEEN dim's `effective_start_date` AND `COALESCE(effective_end_date, '9999-12-31')`) are a follow-up, not part of this item.
- Live evidence: TC25 (dim_supplier) and TC26 (dim_account) showing (1) initial seed produces N current rows, (2) re-run with a tracked-col mutation produces N+1 rows with the mutated supplier/account having one `is_current=false` row and one `is_current=true` row, (3) re-run with no changes is a no-op (no spurious new versions).
- Empty-source case: zero rows, schema intact, no crash.

## Theme: Transforms framework (extract reusable pieces)

### `[ ]` P1.12 — Refactor `transforms/__init__.py` into a real framework
**Why**: After P1.2 + P1.8–P1.11, common patterns will emerge (audit columns, write modes, schema validation). Pull them out so future marts are ~50 LOC each not ~200.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: at least 3 of P1.2 / P1.8 / P1.9 / P1.10 / P1.11 implemented (extract once you see the duplication)
**Accept**: each gold mart's main module is ≤80 LOC; common helpers live in `transforms/` (e.g. `audit_cols()`, `with_dim_join()`, `write_gold_table()`).

## Theme: Release packaging (cuts v0.2.0)

### `[ ]` P1.13 — Build the v0.2.0 `.bar` with 5+ workbooks
**Why**: The CLI does `dashboard install --bar-uri ...`, but no `.bar` ships today. Customers can't run the OAC install end-to-end without authoring workbooks themselves. TC10b–TC10e + TC10h-7 already proved the workbooks render; just need to package them.
**Size**: M (build on dev OAC; export Custom snapshot; smoke-test on second OAC)
**Depends on**: P1.2 (supplier_spend) and P1.8–P1.11 wired so dashboards have real data
**Accept**:
- Custom snapshot (Include: Catalog Content + Shared Folders + Application Roles; Exclude: Credentials, Connections, User Folders, File-based Data, Day by Day, Jobs, Plug-ins, Configuration).
- 5 workbooks under `/shared/AIDP_Fusion_Bundle/`: CFO dashboard, supplier_spend, PO backlog, GL balance trend, AR aging drill-down. Optional 6th: AP aging.
- Strong password (committed in release notes).
- Smoke-tested by running `dashboard install --target oac --bar-uri 'file:///aidp-fusion-bundle/bundle-v0.2.0.bar'` on a clean OAC and getting all 5 workbooks visible.

### `[ ]` P1.14 — Attach `.bar` as GitHub release artifact + bump versions
**Why**: Customers download the `.bar` from the release page, upload to their bucket. Current release page is empty.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: P1.13
**Accept**:
- GitHub release `v0.2.0` with `.bar` attached + release notes (`.bar` password disclosed there).
- `plugin.json` version → `0.2.0`.
- `pyproject.toml` version → `0.2.0`.
- `__init__.py` `__version__` → `0.2.0`.
- CHANGELOG.md cuts `[0.2.0]` section dated.

### `[ ]` P1.15 — Submit PR to `oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples`
**Why**: This personal mirror's whole purpose is staging. Canonical home is the oracle-samples repo. Without the PR, end users can't `/plugin install` from Anthropic's curated marketplace.
**Size**: M (depends on review cycles)
**Depends on**: P1.14
**Accept**: PR open at `oracle-samples/oracle-aidp-samples/ai/claude-code-plugins/oracle-ai-data-platform-fusion-bundle/`; merged or in review.

### `[ ]` P1.16 — Bump marketplace metadata version
**Why**: `marketplace.json` is at `0.5.0` (marketplace-level); when bundle hits 0.2.0, marketplace bumps to track. Decide: every plugin release? Only major plugin changes? Document the policy.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: P1.14
**Accept**: `marketplace.json.metadata.version` bumped (recommend `0.6.0` to mark "fusion-bundle leaves alpha"); README notes the versioning policy.

# P2 — Quality, coverage, polish (do interleaved with P1; not blocking)

## Theme: Bug fixes (real defects, not gaps)

### `[ ]` P2.1 — Replace hardcoded 90s BICC API-key wait with exp backoff
**Why**: `commands/bootstrap.py` waits a fixed 90s for IDCS federation propagation. Fast pods waste 60s; slow pods (>120s) silently fail.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: bootstrap polls `Test Connection` every 15s up to 180s with exp backoff (15, 30, 45, 60, 60); succeeds early when pod is fast; surfaces clear error after 180s.

### `[ ]` P2.2 — Auto-detect populated supplier IDs in `gold.supplier_spend`
**Why**: STATUS.md §5 issue #6: demo pod returns NULL/0 for `VendorId`/`PartyId`; bundle uses spend-only fallback. Production pods should switch to dim_supplier-joined form automatically.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: P1.1 + P1.2 (folds into P1.2's accept criteria — track here for visibility)
**Accept**: `transforms/gold/supplier_spend.py` checks `dim_supplier.id_populated_pct() > 0.5` to pick join vs fallback. Both paths unit-tested.

### `[ ]` P2.3 — Verify `find_connection` substring-vs-exact filter
**Why**: TC10h-3 fix added exact-match filter (`aidp_fusion_jdbc` shouldn't match `aidp_fusion_jdbc_v2`). Need a regression test or it will silently regress.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: `tests/unit/test_oac_rest_client.py` adds parametrized test covering `aidp_fusion_jdbc` vs `aidp_fusion_jdbc_v2` vs `aidp_fusion_jdbc_dev` with mocked OAC response; only exact `aidp_fusion_jdbc` matches.

## Theme: Test coverage

### `[ ]` P2.4a — `make test` default interpreter prefers `.venv/bin/python` when present (follow-up to P2.4, 2026-05-17)
**Why**: P2.4 shipped `Makefile` with `PYTHON ?= python` (`Makefile:6`). On macOS the default `python` is Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/libexec/bin/python` — a bare interpreter with no project dependencies. A fresh contributor cloning the repo and running `make test` (per `README.md:34` and `CONTRIBUTING.md:25`'s "canonical entry point" framing) hits `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'oracle_ai_data_platform_fusion_bundle'` unless they remembered to activate a venv first. The smoke test in this checkout reproduced exactly that: `make test` failed under bare Homebrew python; `make test PYTHON=.venv/bin/python` passed (496 tests).

**Repro**: `git clean -fdx && python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e '.[test]' && make test` (no `source .venv/bin/activate`). Result: `ModuleNotFoundError`. Documented "canonical" path doesn't actually work without an extra activation step the docs don't mandate.

**Two acceptable resolutions**:

(A) **Auto-detect a project-local venv** in the Makefile. Conditional default:
```makefile
PYTHON ?= $(if $(wildcard .venv/bin/python),.venv/bin/python,python)
```
Pros: `make test` "just works" from a fresh checkout after `pip install -e '.[test]'` regardless of activation. Matches the implicit contract of CONTRIBUTING.md's quick-start (which doesn't mention activation). Cons: a contributor with a non-`.venv`-named venv (e.g. `.env`, `venv`, conda) still has to override `PYTHON=` — same friction as today, but the docs now match. Mitigation: a single sentence in CONTRIBUTING.md naming the convention.

(B) **Update the docs to require activation**. README + CONTRIBUTING grow an explicit `source .venv/bin/activate` step before `make test`. Pros: zero Makefile change; convention is documented. Cons: more onboarding ceremony; the "canonical command works regardless of activation" framing in CONTRIBUTING.md:25 is then false (the whole point of P2.4) and would need to be rewritten.

**Recommendation**: (A). P2.4's headline benefit was "works regardless of shell PATH" — (A) extends that promise to "works regardless of shell activation state too", which is what contributors actually want. The conditional is 1 LOC and falls back to the current behavior if `.venv/bin/python` is missing.

**Size**: XS — 1 LOC Makefile + 1 sentence CONTRIBUTING.md ("we look for `.venv/bin/python` first; override with `make test PYTHON=…` for any other venv layout"). ~10 min.
**Depends on**: nothing.
**Accept (Option A)**:
- `Makefile:6` becomes `PYTHON ?= $(if $(wildcard .venv/bin/python),.venv/bin/python,python)`.
- CONTRIBUTING.md "Quick start" §"`make test` is the canonical entry point" sentence gains a one-line note: "we look for `.venv/bin/python` first; override with `make test PYTHON=...` for non-standard venv paths".
- Smoke-verified on macOS zsh in two modes: (i) fresh clone + `python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e '.[test]' && make test` → 496 tests pass without activation; (ii) no `.venv/` dir + venv activated globally → falls through to bare `python`, uses the activated interpreter, still passes.
- Override path still works: `make test PYTHON=/some/other/path/python` overrides the conditional.
**Cross-ref**: P2.4 (BACKLOG:629 — the shipped Makefile); `Makefile:6` (current default); `README.md:34` + `CONTRIBUTING.md:25` (where the canonical-command framing lives that this fix backfills).

### `[x]` P2.4 — Add `make test` target so pytest works regardless of shell PATH (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: This recon session: `pytest` not on PATH → confusing failure. `python -m pytest` works regardless of activation state.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: `Makefile` (or `tasks.py`) has `test` target running `python -m pytest tests/unit -q`. README's quick-start mentions `make test`.
**Done**: `Makefile` ships with `PYTHON ?= python` override + `test` (acceptance: `tests/unit -q`) + `test-all` (full `tests/`, live still env-gated) targets. README Quickstart §1a now shows `pip install -e '.[test]' && make test`. CONTRIBUTING.md:15 flipped from unquoted `.[dev]` (silently zsh-broken since macOS Catalina) to quoted `'.[dev,test]'`, picking up `pytest` deps that the `[dev]` extra lacked. Smoke-verified on zsh: 496 unit tests pass via both `make test` (activated venv) and `make test PYTHON=.venv/bin/python` (override, no activation).

### `[ ]` P2.5 — Live test for `dashboard validate`
**Why**: Read-only probe, easy to test, currently no live coverage.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: existing OAC instance with installed connection (TC10h-4 covered install; reuse)
**Accept**: `tests/live/TC18_dashboard_validate_results.md` with green run.

### `[ ]` P2.6 — Live test for `dashboard uninstall`
**Why**: Closes the install/uninstall round-trip; today only install is live-tested.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: P2.5 (uninstall after validate)
**Accept**: `tests/live/TC19_dashboard_uninstall_results.md` showing connection deleted + snapshot deregistered.

### `[ ]` P2.7 — Smoke test for `dashboard mcp-config`
**Why**: Just prints JSON, but verifying the JSON is valid + paths-substituted-correctly catches future regressions cheaply.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: unit test in `tests/unit/test_commands.py` parses the printed JSON, asserts `mcpServers.oac-mcp-server.{command,args[0],args[1]}`.

### `[ ]` P2.8 — Live test for `--auth-flow device` headless OAuth
**Why**: Device-code path is implemented in `oac/rest/oauth.py` but only mock-tested.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: `tests/live/TC20_device_code_oauth_results.md` showing fresh device-code flow getting an access token.

### `[ ]` P2.9 — Regression test for "PVO names abbreviated" finding
**Why**: TC1 found pdf1's abbreviated names don't work live; bundle catalog now uses full AM-hierarchies. Lock that in so a future "simplification" PR doesn't regress.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: `tests/unit/test_fusion_catalog.py` parametrized test asserting every confirmed PVO has at least 4 dot-separated AM segments (e.g. `FscmTopModelAM.PrcExtractAM.PozBiccExtractAM.SupplierExtractPVO`).

### `[ ]` P2.10 — Schema migration test for `oac.workbooks` → `oac.snapshot`
**Why**: TC10h-2 changed bundle.yaml schema. Pre-TC10h-2 bundle.yaml files silently break. Validate clearly.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: `validate` command emits a clear error when it sees the legacy `oac.workbooks: [...]` shape, points user at the migration note in CHANGELOG.

### `[ ]` P2.11 — saas-batch live test (placeholder)
**Why**: When a customer HCM pod becomes available (P3.C2), we need a TC ready to drop in.
**Size**: XS (skeleton); S (when run live)
**Depends on**: P3.C2 customer access
**Accept**: `tests/live/TC11_TC17_saas_batch_results.md` already documents the path; add a `### Pending live` section so contributors know what to fill in when the pod arrives.

## Theme: Documentation

### `[ ]` P2.12 — Write `docs/customizing.md` (custom COA segments + per-customer org dim flavors)
**Why**: STATUS.md §4.7 references this; doesn't exist.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: P1.3 (`dim_account`) — content needs the actual extension points
**Accept**: doc covers (a) adding custom COA segment columns, (b) regional org-hierarchy variants, (c) test patterns for customizations.

### `[ ]` P2.13 — Write `docs/cross-source-recipes.md` (Fusion ×Salesforce / ×S3 / ×Workday)
**Why**: README hints at this use case; no concrete pattern documented.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: at least one gold mart implemented (P1.2 minimum)
**Accept**: 3 worked examples joining Fusion gold marts to non-Fusion sources via the connectors plugin.

### `[ ]` P2.14 — Add `PRIVACY.md` matching the connectors plugin
**Why**: Sibling plugin (`oracle-ai-data-platform-workbench-spark-connectors`) ships a `PRIVACY.md`. Fusion-bundle should match for consistency + customer trust (data-handling statement).
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**: `PRIVACY.md` exists with at minimum: data-flow diagram, what credentials touch what files, retention policy.

### `[x]` P2.15 — Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` (shipped 2026-05-11)
**Why**: Once the oracle-samples PR merges (P1.15), external contributors will arrive. Set the bar.
**Done**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` ships covering (a) `make test` + `ruff` pre-commit, (b) test running (unit + live-gated under `AIDP_FUSION_BUNDLE_INTEGRATION=1`), (c) live-test conventions (TC numbering, evidence-file shape, tenant identification, anomaly handling, re-verification-after-refactor rule), (d) PR template with plugin-portability checklist, (e) module checklist for new dim/mart spanning code shape, plugin-portability, medallion correctness, performance, SQL correctness, and CLI wiring. Cross-refs `CLAUDE.md` for the working principles split.

## Theme: Plugin durability across Fusion releases

### `[ ]` P2.16 — Schema-drift fingerprint + `catalog drift` command
**Why**: Every gold mart and silver dim hardcodes column names that came from a one-time live probe of the source PVO (e.g. `CodeCombinationCodeCombinationId`, `ApInvoicesVendorId`). Oracle revs PVOs across Fusion releases — column renames are uncommon but documented (the abbreviated-vs-full-AM-hierarchy thing in pdf1 was exactly this drift class). Today nothing detects this; first symptom on a customer's upgraded pod is `silver` build failing with "column not found" — loud, but no mitigation path.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: P1.1 / P1.3 / P1.4 bronze tables existing on a live pod (✅ all done)
**Accept**:
- New `tests/live/schemas/<pvo_id>.json` snapshot per confirmed PVO, capturing `[(col_name, dtype)]` plus the date + Fusion release the snapshot was taken on.
- New `aidp-fusion-bundle catalog drift` CLI command that re-extracts each PVO, computes a fresh fingerprint, diffs vs stored, exits non-zero with a clear summary of added/removed/renamed/retyped columns.
- Snapshots committed for the existing PVOs (`erp_suppliers`, `ap_invoices`, `gl_coa`, `ar_invoices`, `ar_receipts`, `po_orders`, `po_receipts`).
- Unit test on the diff function with synthetic before/after schemas.
- README "operations" section documents the command and recommends running it after Fusion-release upgrades.

### `[ ]` P2.17 — Fusion release-version detection + support-matrix warning
**Why**: Even before any drift fires, customers should know whether their Fusion release is one we've actually verified. Today the bundle is silent; if a customer is on an unverified release, they discover the gap only when something breaks.
**Size**: S
**Depends on**: nothing
**Accept**:
- `SUPPORTED_FUSION_RELEASES: set[str]` constant in `schema/fusion_catalog.py` (or new `schema/support_matrix.py`); seeded with the releases we've live-verified against (e.g. `{"25C", "26A"}`).
- New helper that reads the customer's Fusion release at runtime (Fusion exposes its release version via a REST `about`-style endpoint — confirm exact path during implementation; pdf1 / aidp-fusion-bicc skill likely have a hint).
- `aidp-fusion-bundle install` and `aidp-fusion-bundle run` print a clear warning (not a hard failure) when the detected release is not in `SUPPORTED_FUSION_RELEASES`. Exit code 0 — informational.
- README "compatibility" section lists the supported releases and the policy ("verified releases get version-pinned bundle releases; later releases require running `catalog drift` first").
- Unit test mocks the about-endpoint response and verifies the warning fires for an unknown release and stays silent for a known one.

## Theme: Medallion performance — quick wins (round-6 perf audit, 2026-05-11)

### `[x]` P2.18 — Hoist decimal casts in `gl_balance` into a CTE (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: `transforms/gold/gl_balance.py:262-272` cast the same four `decimal(38,30)` amount columns to `DECIMAL(28, 2)` twice each — once in the surfaced projection (`begin_balance_dr`, `begin_balance_cr`, `period_net_dr`, `period_net_cr`) and again inside the `closing_balance` formula's `COALESCE(CAST(...))` wrappers. Catalyst doesn't reliably CSE across `CAST` boundaries on high-precision decimals; at 11M rows this is measurable CPU. `ap_aging` already got this right via the `open_invoices` CTE (`ap_aging.py:431-445`) — cast once, outer SELECT operates on cast values.
**Done**: `build_gl_balance_sql` emits a `WITH balances AS (...)` CTE that performs each `CAST(... AS DECIMAL(28, 2))` exactly once (audit verified: 1/1/1/1); outer SELECT projects the four amount columns from the CTE without re-casting (`b.begin_balance_dr AS begin_balance_dr`, etc.); `closing_balance` is `ROUND(COALESCE(b.begin_balance_dr, 0) - COALESCE(b.begin_balance_cr, 0) + COALESCE(b.period_net_dr, 0) - COALESCE(b.period_net_cr, 0), 2)` — the `COALESCE(..., 0)` NULL-safety wrap stays on every term. LEFT JOIN preserved-fact-side maintained: `FROM balances b LEFT JOIN {silver_dim} da`. `tests/unit/test_gl_balance.py` 41 tests green; 2 tests updated to assert the new CTE shape (`test_uses_left_join_not_inner` split into "FROM gl_period_balances exists" + "FROM balances LEFT JOIN dim_account"; `test_closing_balance_formula` references CTE columns) while still enforcing the original invariants.

### `[x]` P2.19 — Project `currency_code` once in `supplier_spend` CTE (shipped 2026-05-17)
**Why**: `transforms/gold/supplier_spend.py:105, 122-123` emitted `UPPER(CAST(inv.{currency_col} AS STRING))` in both the SELECT projection and the GROUP BY — same expression twice. Spark usually CSEs this but with `UPPER(CAST(...))` chains it sometimes doesn't, and it prevents the shuffle from using a precomputed partition column. `ap_aging` already projects `currency_code` once in its `open_invoices` CTE.
**Done**: `build_supplier_spend_sql` emits a `WITH invoices AS (...)` CTE that projects `UPPER(CAST(inv.{currency_col} AS STRING)) AS currency_code` exactly once AND `CAST(inv.ApInvoicesVendorId AS BIGINT) AS vendor_id` exactly once (audit verified). Outer SELECT, JOIN ON, and GROUP BY all reference `inv.currency_code` and `inv.vendor_id`. NULL-safe amount aggregation preserved: `SUM(COALESCE(CAST(inv.ApInvoicesInvoiceAmount AS DECIMAL(20, 2)), 0))` and same for `AmountPaid` (amount casts intentionally kept inline because they only run inside `SUM(COALESCE(CAST(...)))` — pulling them into the CTE wouldn't save work). LEFT JOIN preserved-fact-side maintained: `FROM invoices inv LEFT JOIN {silver_dim} ds`. `WHERE inv.ApInvoicesVendorId IS NOT NULL` moved into CTE body (vendor-id presence filter preserved). `tests/unit/test_supplier_spend.py` 33 tests green; 3 tests updated to assert the new CTE shape (`test_uses_left_join_not_inner` split; `test_grouping_uses_invoice_vendor_id` verifies CTE projection + `inv.vendor_id` in GROUP BY; `test_currency_code_in_group_by` verifies CTE UPPER+CAST + `inv.currency_code` in GROUP BY) while still enforcing the original invariants.

### `[ ]` P2.20 — Single-pass `ap_aging` build (cache filtered bronze)
**Why**: `ap_aging.build()` with `due_date_mode='auto'` runs `_measure_due_date_coverage()` (`transforms/gold/ap_aging.py:608-619`) — one full scan of `bronze.ap_invoices` with the open-invoice WHERE clause — then `build_ap_aging_sql()` re-scans the same filtered bronze for materialization. 50k rows on demo is nothing; on a tenant with 10M+ open invoices that's 2× the IO with identical filter predicates. Two viable fixes: (1) cache the filtered DataFrame between the two queries; (2) compute coverage as a windowed column inside the materialization, abort/rerun as proxy if below threshold (single scan, but couples concerns). Recommend (1) unless live evidence shows the cache size is prohibitive.
**Size**: S — small refactor + live re-verification of TC24 to confirm timing improvement; ensure cache is released after the build.
**Depends on**: nothing.
**Accept**: one filtered-bronze scan per build in `due_date_mode='auto'`; live evidence (TC24c) shows ~halved IO vs TC24 baseline on the same tenant; existing 30+ `test_ap_aging.py` tests pass (cache is Spark-side, doesn't change the asserted SQL shape).

### `[ ]` P2.21 — Add Delta auto-optimize table properties to bronze + silver + gold
**Why**: None of the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE … USING DELTA` statements set `TBLPROPERTIES`. Daily incremental refresh on AIDP's Spark cluster will produce thousands of small files within a few months → manifest read time dominates per-query latency. Standard Delta-Lake fix is `delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite=true` + `delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact=true` on tables that get frequent writes (bronze + silver primarily; gold benefits less because gold is read-target, not write-hot-path).
**Size**: S — DDL-only addition to each `CREATE TABLE` template + a periodic `OPTIMIZE` call in the orchestrator.
**Depends on**: nothing.
**Accept**:
- Every bronze + silver `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` includes `TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true', 'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true')`.
- Gold tables get `TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true')` (autoCompact less relevant for write-once-per-refresh gold).
- Orchestrator (P1.5) runs `OPTIMIZE <gold_table>` weekly (or after seed load).
- Unit test asserts emitted SQL contains the expected `TBLPROPERTIES` clauses.

## Theme: Plugin-portability — evidence-driven knobs (deferred)

### `[ ]` P2.22 — Evidence-driven knob backlog (defer until a customer hits each)
**Why**: Round-6 plugin-portability audit (2026-05-11) surfaced more hardcoded values in the new dim/gold modules. The principle established with P1.5a / P1.11a is: knobs ship when a real tenant surfaces the variant, not preemptively. Capture the list so future-us doesn't re-derive it. None of these block any current customer.
**Specific candidates** (location → trigger condition → knob shape when promoted):
- **Aging bucket boundaries `0/30/60/90`** (`transforms/gold/ap_aging.py:314-339`, `_bucket_case`) — promote when a customer needs `0/15/30/45/60` or `0/30/60/90/120/150`. Shape: `aging_buckets: Sequence[tuple[int, str]]`.
- **NET-30 residual fallback** (`transforms/gold/ap_aging.py:258-266`, `_due_date_coalesce_expr`) — promote when a customer's standard terms are NET-45 or NET-60. Shape: `net_days_fallback: int = 30`.
- **Cancelled-flag truthy value `'Y'`** (`transforms/gold/ap_aging.py:295`, `_cancelled_filter`) — promote when a tenant's extract emits `'Cancelled'` / `'1'` / `'TRUE'`. Shape: `cancelled_flag_truthy: str = 'Y'`.
- **`dim_supplier` hardcoded column names** (`dimensions/dim_supplier.py:63-95`) — no schema-variant knobs or `detect_*_params()` probe (regression from the `ap_aging` standard). Promote when a tenant's `SupplierExtractPVO` is missing `AlternateNamePartyName` / `BUSINESSRELATIONSHIP` / similar and crashes with `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN`. Fix shape: apply the same detect+kwargs pattern `ap_aging` uses.
- **Fiscal-year naming convention** (`dimensions/dim_calendar.py:97-103`) — assumes "FY = calendar year FY ends in". Promote when an EU tenant uses "FY = calendar year FY begins in". Shape: `fy_naming: Literal["ends_in", "begins_in"] = "ends_in"`.

**Out of scope (intentionally skipped)**:
- COA segment default map (`dimensions/dim_account.py:106-113`, `transforms/gold/gl_balance.py:132-139`) — already overridable via `semantic_segment_map` / `coa_segment_map`; default matches majority Fusion convention; no action needed.
- Calendar date range default `2020 → 2030` (`dimensions/dim_calendar.py:41-42`) — `start_date` / `end_date` kwargs already exist; only gap is surfacing them in `bundle.yaml` schema, which falls under P1.5b's plumbing scope.

**Size**: 0 today (capture only); each promoted item is XS-S when triggered.
**Depends on**: customer-driven evidence.
**Accept**: this entry stays open until either (a) every sub-item has a fielded report + promoted backlog entry, or (b) v1.0 ships with confidence the list is non-load-bearing.

## Theme: Security hardening

### `[ ]` P2.23 — Secret-handling hardening before first non-`saasfademo1` customer
**Why**: P1.5α ships `SecretStr` wrapping (`_resolve_password()` in `orchestrator/runtime.py` — see the §4.9) so resolved credentials don't leak through `repr`/`str`/`debug` accidents. But the schema-level footgun is still open: `schema/bundle.py:73` declares `password: str` and accepts a literal value equally with `${vault:OCID}` / `${env:VAR}` — Pydantic does not reject `password: hunter2`. In dev phase this is acceptable (1 user, both example bundles use the sigil, demo-pod creds, `_resolve_password()` logs a WARN on literals). At first non-`saasfademo1` customer onboarding, this becomes a real "creds in git history" risk and must be closed before the customer's `bundle.yaml` lands in a repo. Four hardening items, each cheap individually, sized together because they share the secret-resolution code path.
**Size**: M — schema-validator + preflight + env-var gating + lint, ~3-4h plus tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped (this builds on `_resolve_password()` + `SecretStr` plumbing). Triggered by P3.7 (first non-`saasfademo1` customer) — must land **before** that customer's bundle is committed anywhere.
**Items**:
1. **Reject literal passwords at config-load**: Pydantic `field_validator` on `FusionConn.password` enforces the sigil grammar (`^\$\{vault:OCID\}$` or `^\$\{env:VAR\}$`). Literal values raise `ValueError` at `bundle.yaml` load — fails fast, before any orchestrator code runs, before Spark touches anything. Removes the dev-phase WARN from `_resolve_password()` since the validator catches it first.
2. **Vault-OCID accessibility preflight**: `orchestrator.run()` setup calls `aidputils.secrets.get(ocid)` once before any DAG dispatch. Fails fast with a clear "vault OCID not accessible — check IAM policy" before the first bronze extract. Same shape for `${env:VAR}` — assert env-var is set at startup, not at first BICC call.
3. **Env-var gating in `commands/catalog.py:76`**: today's `pwd = password or os.environ.get("FUSION_BICC_PASSWORD")` is a perfectly valid dev convenience for the ad-hoc CLI flow, but bundle-driven `run` should agree with the bundle path on policy. Add `--allow-env-creds` flag (or `AIDP_ENV=dev` gate) so prod CLI runs reject env-var-derived creds unless the bundle explicitly opts in via `password: ${env:VAR}`.
4. **Debug-log masking lint**: grep rule (CI step) preventing `debug(...password...)` / `debug(...bundle.fusion...)` patterns. Catches the future "added a debug call and accidentally logged the password" defect at PR time, not production time. Complements `SecretStr`'s `repr` masking — the regex catches the case where someone calls `secret.get_secret_value()` and logs the result.

**Accept**:
- `bundle.yaml` with `password: hunter2` is rejected by Pydantic with a clear error message naming both sigil forms.
- `orchestrator.run()` exits 2 with "vault OCID `ocid1.vaultsecret.…` not accessible — check IAM" when the OCID is bad, before any Spark work.
- `aidp-fusion-bundle catalog probe --pod X` (no `--password`, no `--allow-env-creds`) errors with "set --password or pass --allow-env-creds for dev use" instead of silently picking up `FUSION_BICC_PASSWORD` from env.
- CI greps the repo for `debug(.*password|debug(.*\.fusion\.` and fails the build on a match.
- Unit tests cover all four items; live evidence on `saasfademo1` shows the validator + preflight running cleanly with the existing example bundles.

## Theme: Claude-assisted diagnostics + tenant customization

### `[ ]` P2.24 — `aidp-fusion-bundle doctor` root-cause command
**Why**: Claude and operators currently debug failures by stitching together Rich output, `fusion_bundle_state`, table existence, preflight messages, and ad-hoc Spark queries. That makes the AI guessy and makes customer support inconsistent. A dedicated `doctor` command should turn the latest run into a concise root-cause report with evidence and safe next actions.
**Size**: M — new `commands/doctor.py`, CLI wiring, state/table readers, tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α state table + P1.5α-fix21 resume/latest-view metadata; benefits from P2.25 when error codes exist.
**Accept**:
- `aidp-fusion-bundle doctor --run-id <id>` reads `fusion_bundle_state` / `fusion_bundle_state_latest`, validates expected bronze/silver/gold tables exist, and reports failed/deferred/skipped nodes with evidence.
- Output includes stable fields: `problem`, `evidence`, `likely_cause`, `safe_fix`, `needs_user_input`, and `next_command`.
- `doctor` never prints secrets or full bundle contents; redaction tests cover Fusion URL, username, password refs, Vault OCIDs, and env var names.
- Unit tests cover: latest successful run, failed bronze schema probe, failed silver/gold build, missing table despite success state, and resume-skipped carry-forward.
- Cross-ref: P2.25 (structured diagnostics), P2.26 (customization registry), P3.26 (structured JSON logging).

### `[ ]` P2.25 — Structured diagnostics artifact + stable error-code remediation map
**Why**: Free-form logs are bad input for AI debugging. Claude needs structured facts: what node ran, which schema was chosen, what watermark was used, what exception class/code happened, and what remediation is allowed. This should be a local artifact, not only console text.
**Size**: M — `orchestrator/diagnostics.py`, error-code helpers, write path, tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α state table; pairs naturally with P2.24.
**Accept**:
- Each orchestrator run can emit `diagnostics/<run_id>.jsonl` (path configurable or defaulting under the working directory) with one JSON object per run/step event.
- Step records include at least: `run_id`, `dataset_id`, `layer`, `mode`, `status`, `row_count`, `effective_schema`, `watermark_used`, `last_watermark`, `duration_seconds`, `error_type`, `error_code`, `message_redacted`, `recommendation`.
- Add a central remediation map for stable codes such as `BICC_SCHEMA_NOT_FOUND`, `BICC_AUTH_FAILED`, `MISSING_REQUIRED_COLUMN`, `STATE_WATERMARK_READ_FAILED`, `BRONZE_DESTRUCTIVE_INCREMENTAL_BLOCKED`, `OAC_CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND`, and `UNKNOWN_ORCHESTRATOR_ERROR`.
- Exceptions that already have structured classes use their class/code directly; message-inspection classifiers remain quarantined in one helper with unit tests.
- Redaction tests assert no password, Vault secret value, auth token, or raw connection JSON can appear in the JSONL artifact.
- `doctor` consumes this artifact when present and falls back to state/table inspection when absent.

### `[ ]` P2.26 — Tenant customization registry backed by `bundle.yaml`
**Why**: Customer-specific fixes should not become one-off Python edits. The plugin already has scattered knobs (`schemaOverrides`, COA maps, aging behavior, fiscal calendar options), but there is no single contract Claude can inspect to decide whether a tenant problem is solved by config, discovery, or code. Centralizing override definitions makes customization bounded and reviewable.
**Size**: L — schema additions, `config/overrides.py`, module plumbing, migration docs, tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5a portability plumbing; promotes selected P2.22 knobs only when supported by evidence.
**Accept**:
- Add `config/overrides.py` with typed override definitions, validation helpers, docs strings, and "when to use" guidance for each supported knob.
- `bundle.yaml` schema exposes only proven override families: BICC `schemaOverrides`, COA semantic segments, calendar range/fiscal naming, column aliases for known modules, natural-key overrides where MERGE requires them, and incremental `watermark_safety_window_seconds` after P1.17 consumes watermarks.
- Every override has one of three classifications: `tenant_declared_policy`, `data_shape_discovery_override`, or `dangerous_escape_hatch`; dangerous entries require explicit opt-in naming the risk.
- `doctor` recommends config overrides only when the failed diagnostic code maps to a supported override; otherwise it says "code change required" or "unsupported tenant variant".
- Tests cover schema validation, unknown override rejection, override precedence over discovery, and at least one end-to-end module consuming each override family.
- Cross-ref: P2.12 (`docs/customizing.md`) becomes the user-facing guide for this registry; P2.22 remains the evidence backlog for future knobs.

### `[ ]` P2.27 — Debug evidence pack + Claude workflow docs
**Why**: When a customer asks Claude to debug a run, the prompt should include a sanitized evidence pack instead of screenshots or pasted logs. The repo also needs explicit workflows that distinguish "review only", "debug and patch", and "tenant customization", so agents do not accidentally edit code during a plan review or invent unsupported knobs during debugging.
**Size**: S-M — CLI helper + docs + redaction tests.
**Depends on**: P2.24 / P2.25 for richest evidence; can start with state/table snapshots.
**Accept**:
- `aidp-fusion-bundle debug collect --run-id <id> --out debug_artifacts/<run_id>` writes a redacted pack containing: selected state rows, diagnostics JSONL, bundle config shape with secrets redacted, table-existence summary, schema probe results, CLI version, and environment metadata safe for support.
- The command refuses to include raw data rows by default; `--include-sample-rows` requires an explicit warning/confirmation flag and still redacts configured sensitive columns.
- Add `docs/workflows/review_only.md`, `docs/workflows/debug_mode.md`, and `docs/workflows/customize_tenant.md` with agent instructions, allowed actions, required evidence, and stop conditions.
- Unit tests assert the evidence pack is valid JSON/Markdown, deterministic enough for snapshots, and redacts credentials.
- Update `CLAUDE.md` cross-references so Claude knows to ask for or generate a debug pack before proposing custom code.

### `[ ]` P2.28 — Focused Claude skills for debugging, customization, live evidence, and review
**Why**: The current `skills/aidp-fusion-bundle/SKILL.md` is a broad product/onboarding skill. It helps Claude understand the plugin, but it does not give crisp mode-specific behavior for high-risk work. Debugging a failed customer run, reviewing a plan, collecting live evidence, and customizing a tenant need different guardrails. Separate focused skills keep Claude from mixing modes (e.g., editing code during a read-only plan review, or inventing a tenant knob while debugging).
**Size**: S — five concise `SKILL.md` files, optional small references, marketplace metadata update.
**Depends on**: P2.24 / P2.25 / P2.27 for the best debug inputs, but the skills can land earlier and reference those as future preferred artifacts.
**Skill set**:
- `aidp-fusion-debug-run`: triggered by "debug failed run", "doctor", "run_id", "why did orchestrator fail"; reads `doctor` output, diagnostics JSONL, state rows, and table existence before naming a root cause.
- `aidp-fusion-customize-tenant`: triggered by "custom tenant", "schema variant", "column missing", "COA mapping", "override"; classifies the issue as tenant-declared policy vs data-shape discovery vs code gap, prefers supported `bundle.yaml` overrides, and rejects speculative knobs.
- `aidp-fusion-live-evidence`: triggered by "run live TC", "validate on tenant", "TC26", "TC28"; follows `tests/live/*.md` evidence format, captures operator-redacted outputs, and never records secrets or raw customer data.
- `aidp-fusion-plan-review`: triggered by "review plan"; read-only plan review against medallion correctness, state-table contracts, tenant portability, acceptance criteria, tests, and live evidence.
- `aidp-fusion-orchestrator-debug`: triggered by "fix orchestrator", "state table", "watermark", "resume", "incremental"; code-focused workflow for `orchestrator/` internals, targeted unit tests, and `CLAUDE.md` invariants.
**Accept**:
- Add skill directories under `skills/` (or the plugin-approved skill location) with concise frontmatter descriptions that trigger only on their intended task.
- Each skill names allowed mode, first files to inspect, required evidence, and stop conditions.
- `aidp-fusion-plan-review` explicitly says read-only unless the user asks to patch.
- `aidp-fusion-customize-tenant` explicitly says "no new config knob without real tenant evidence or documented Oracle source"; cross-ref P2.22 and P2.26.
- `aidp-fusion-debug-run` prefers `doctor` / diagnostics JSONL / debug evidence pack when present, and falls back to `fusion_bundle_state` + targeted repo reads when absent.
- Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` or plugin metadata so the new skills are discoverable in a predictable order.
- Smoke test by asking Claude five realistic prompts (one per skill) and confirming the intended skill triggers without loading unrelated workflows.

# P3 — Roadmap, upstream, tracked blockers (don't act now; track)

## Theme: v3+ roadmap

### `[ ]` P3.1 — `agent ask "..."` CLI helper
**Why**: TC9 proved `ai_generate('openai.gpt-5.4', ...)` against `gold.supplier_spend`. Wrap as a CLI sugar for ad-hoc agent queries.
**Size**: M
**Depends on**: P1.2+ gold marts available
**Accept**: `aidp-fusion-bundle agent ask "which suppliers had >$1M Q1 spend?"` returns grounded answer with citations.

### `[ ]` P3.2 — Delta Sharing provider config
**Why**: README mentions it as v3 roadmap. Share curated gold-layer datasets with external partners without copies.
**Size**: L
**Depends on**: P1.13 (need the marts to share); AIDP-side Delta Sharing provisioning
**Accept**: bundle.yaml `delta_sharing: { enabled: true, recipients: [...] }` block; CLI emits share-recipient config.

### `[ ]` P3.10 — Orchestrator parallel execution *(orchestrator-evolution design item E)*
**Why**: P1.5α explicitly chose sequential execution (the §7). Rationale at the time: saasfademo1 seed run finishes in <2 min and parallelism complicates failure-mode semantics. Trigger to revisit: any tenant where the seed run exceeds ~5 min wall-clock, OR where multiple bronze extracts could run concurrently against independent PVOs. The orchestrator's DAG already encodes dependencies (`depends_on_bronze`, `depends_on_silver`) — parallelism is a scheduler swap, not a re-architecture (e.g. `concurrent.futures` thread pool driving `graphlib.TopologicalSorter`'s ready-set).
**Size**: M — swap the topo executor for a ready-set scheduler; preserve fail-fast semantics; bounded worker count (config knob, default 4).
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped; live evidence on at least one tenant where sequential runtime is the bottleneck.
**Accept**:
- `orchestrator.run()` gains `max_workers: int = 1` kwarg (default keeps today's sequential behavior).
- Independent bronze extracts (no shared PVO) and independent dim builds run concurrently up to `max_workers`.
- Fail-fast preserved: a failed step still skips dependents and halts new dispatches.
- Live evidence: TC<N> showing wall-clock reduction on a tenant with ≥4 enabled datasets.

### `[ ]` P3.11 — Orchestrator step-level retries *(orchestrator-evolution design item S)*
**Why**: P1.5α explicitly chose fail-fast (the §7) — re-run the CLI if a step fails. Trigger to revisit: transient BICC failures (rate-limit 429s, network blips, OAC connection timeouts) observed in real customer runs. Distinct from P2.1 (BICC API-key bootstrap exp backoff, one-shot at install time) — this is per-step retry at run time. Should be scoped to *transient* errors only (network, rate-limit), not data-correctness errors (schema mismatch, NULL currency hard-gate); the orchestrator must classify before retrying or it will mask real bugs.
**Size**: M — retry policy (max attempts, backoff curve), error classification (`RetryableError` vs `FatalError`), `fusion_bundle_state` schema extension (attempt count per step).
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped; a documented transient-failure incident from a real run.
**Accept**:
- `orchestrator.run()` gains `retry_policy: RetryPolicy | None = None` kwarg (default: no retries — preserves today's fail-fast).
- Module-raised exceptions classified into retryable (network, rate-limit) vs fatal (schema, data); only retryable trigger retry.
- `fusion_bundle_state` rows record `attempt: int` so post-hoc analysis sees retry behavior.
- Unit-tested with a fake extractor that raises retryable then succeeds.

### `[ ]` P3.12 — Orchestrator failure alerting / notifications
**Why**: `NotificationsSpec` already exists in `schema/bundle.py` but no consumer. P1.5α §7 acknowledges this and defers. Trigger to revisit: first customer asking for "tell me when the daily seed run fails" — likely after the bundle is in scheduled production use (post-v0.2.0). Channels customers will want: email (SMTP), Slack webhook, OCI Notifications service. Keep the alerter pluggable so a customer with a custom incident-management tool can wire their own.
**Size**: M — define `Alerter` protocol; ship two concrete implementations (Slack webhook + OCI Notifications); orchestrator invokes on `RunSummary.failed > 0` after the run completes.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped; at least one customer asking for it (don't speculate on payload shape).
**Accept**:
- `bundle.yaml` `notifications: { on_failure: [...] }` block consumed by the orchestrator after the run.
- Slack webhook + OCI Notifications implementations included; both unit-tested with a fake HTTP layer.
- Failure alert payload includes: bundle project, run_id, failed step name + error message, link to `fusion_bundle_state` query for full detail.
- Alerter invocation never blocks or fails the run itself (log + swallow on alerter exception).

## Theme: Upstream advocacy (not bundle-fixable)

### `[ ]` P3.3 — File issue with Oracle AIDP team re: Resource Principal env vars
**Why**: AIDP sets `AIDP_AUTH=resource_principal` but doesn't provide `OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_RPST` / `OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_PRIVATE_PEM` → RP fails. Affects every plugin; bundle works around with API Key + inline PEM.
**Size**: XS (file issue); blocking until resolved
**Depends on**: nothing on our side
**Accept**: issue filed, link captured in this backlog. When Oracle ships the fix, simplify auth helpers (delete inline-PEM code path).

### `[ ]` P3.4 — File issue with Oracle OAC team re: `idljdbc` connectionType
**Why**: OAC's REST validator doesn't bless AIDP's `idljdbc` → `POST /catalog/connections` 400s on first install. Customer must use OAC UI workaround.
**Size**: XS (file issue); blocking until resolved
**Depends on**: nothing on our side
**Accept**: issue filed referencing TC10h-4 evidence. When OAC ships AIDP connection-type validation, we can remove the `--print-only` UI-upload step.

### `[ ]` P3.5 — File issue with Oracle Fusion team re: PVO name documentation
**Why**: pdf1's abbreviated PVO names don't work live (TC1). Doc should match the live BICC catalog format.
**Size**: XS
**Depends on**: nothing on our side
**Accept**: issue filed; if accepted, this backlog item references the doc fix.

### `[~]` ~~P3.13 — File issue with Oracle AIDP team re: notebook-job submission REST API~~ — **PROMOTED to P1.5ε**
**Why cancelled**: Oracle published the `aiwap` REST API on 2026-04-30, including the `POST /jobs` + `POST /jobRuns` + `fetchOutput` flow this item asked for. No longer an advocacy item — implementable work, now tracked as **P1.5ε** under "Plugin-portability follow-ups." See that entry for schema facts and acceptance criteria.

## Theme: Tracked blockers (waiting for environments)

### `[ ]` P3.6 — Customer Fusion HCM pod for saas-batch live test
**Why**: Demo pod (`saasfademo1`) returns 404 on `/saas-batch/security/tokenrelay` — HCM-tier feature, paying customers only. 14 unit tests cover the path.
**Size**: 0 (blocker only)
**Depends on**: customer engagement
**Accept**: when a customer pod arrives, run TC11–TC17 (P2.11) and update results.

### `[ ]` P3.7 — Customer pod with populated supplier IDs
**Why**: Demo pod's `SupplierExtractPVO` returns NULL/0 for `VendorId`/`PartyId`. Production pods needed to validate the join-form `gold.supplier_spend` (P2.2).
**Size**: 0 (blocker only)
**Depends on**: customer engagement
**Accept**: TC8 re-run on production-shape data; gold mart auto-detection (P2.2) verified.

### `[ ]` P3.8 — Customer pod for `dim_org` PVO confirmation
**Why**: P1.7 (`dim_org`) blocked on identifying the right HCM/HR PVO via live `catalog probe`.
**Size**: 0 (blocker only)
**Depends on**: customer engagement
**Accept**: PVO name added to `schema/fusion_catalog.py`; P1.7 unblocks.

### `[ ]` P3.9 — Dedicated CI test pod for live PVO regression
**Why**: P2.16 (`catalog drift`) gives customers a tool to detect drift on their pod, but without a CI-accessible Fusion pod we can't catch drift between releases on the bundle's own side. Demo pod (`saasfademo1`) is shared, rate-limited, and unreliable for scheduled runs; customer pods must never be touched from CI. The right fix is an AIDP-side dedicated plugin-CI pod with stable creds, refreshed monthly, opt-in for the plugin to run a small live extract per PVO and assert schema fingerprint stability.
**Size**: 0 (blocker only — depends on AIDP infra)
**Depends on**: AIDP team provisioning a CI-accessible Fusion pod; P2.16 fingerprint command exists
**Accept**: GitHub Actions (or AIDP-internal CI) workflow runs nightly: extracts each `confirmed=True` PVO, diffs against stored fingerprint, opens an issue on drift. Same pod is reused for the saas-batch live test (P2.11) so it covers two blockers at once.

## Theme: Orchestrator evolution menu (2026-05-15)

> Compact tracker entries for items from the orchestrator design-doc menu. Full analysis (problem framing, sizing rationale, hypotheticals considered) lives in the maintainer's orchestrator-evolution design notes — the letter at the end of each title is the cross-reference key. Items already tracked elsewhere have been annotated above: **A** → P1.Xb (elevate to α), **E** → P3.10, **S** → P3.11. **L** (bundle schema versioning) was elevated to ship in α and lives in the §4.4d, not in this section.
>
> When elevating one of these from "menu entry" to "real work item," expand into a full plan-analysis entry (problem statement + options + tradeoffs + chosen approach + plan edits + acceptance criteria) following the P1.5α-fix1..fix7 pattern. A DECISION doc is warranted when the tradeoff axis is non-obvious (data-correctness vs performance vs UX).

### β prerequisite — mandatory for P1.5β

#### `[ ]` P3.20 — Watermark window bounds for incremental extraction (DESIGN item K)
**Why**: Fusion BICC has max-window constraints on some PVOs (>90 days fails). If a tenant runs incremental after a 3-month gap (vacation, freeze period), passing a single 90+ day window crashes deep in `extract_pvo()` with a Fusion-side error. Helper chunks the window into ≤85-day spans.
**Size**: S — `_chunk_watermark_window(start, end, max_window_days=85) → list[(start, end)]` + tests. ~45 min.
**Depends on**: P1.5β incremental implementation.
**Accept**: any incremental extract spanning >85 days is automatically chunked; live evidence on one tenant showing a multi-chunk extract completes.

### β — early post-α (UX + quality wins)

#### `[ ]` P3.21 — Idempotency contract test per module (DESIGN item B)
**Why**: Each silver/gold `build()` claims `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` semantics. Nothing enforces it. A `current_timestamp()` baked into a non-audit column, or a side-effect to an external system, would slip through single-run unit tests.
**Size**: XS — one ~3-LOC property test per module ("run twice, assert row count + value checksum match").
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped.
**Accept**: every shipped silver dim + gold mart has a `test_<name>_is_idempotent` test that runs `build()` twice and asserts byte-equivalent outputs.

#### `[ ]` P3.22 — Bronze freshness rendered in `status()` output (DESIGN item D)
**Why**: Operators have a "do I need to re-extract?" question every iteration. Today the answer requires reading `fusion_bundle_state` raw rows. A "X days stale" line in the dashboard is operator-UX gold for ~10 LOC.
**Size**: XS — formatting tweak in the existing `status()` renderer using `fusion_bundle_state.last_run_at` per dataset.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped (state table populated).
**Accept**: `aidp-fusion-bundle status` shows "bronze.ap_invoices: 14 days stale" / "bronze.gl_period_balances: fresh (2h ago)" per dataset.

#### `[ ]` P3.23 — Step-level timing breakdown (DESIGN item R)
**Why**: `RunStep.duration_seconds` today is one number. When `ap_invoices` runs slow, operator can't tell whether to call OCI support (Delta slow), Oracle support (BICC slow), or accept the cost (genuinely large extract). Four numbers (extract / enrich / write / count) diagnose.
**Size**: XS — ~10 LOC of timing wrappers + state-table columns + tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α state-table schema (treat as a minor schema evolution).
**Accept**: `fusion_bundle_state` gains `extract_seconds`, `enrich_seconds`, `write_seconds`, `count_seconds`; `status()` surfaces the breakdown when `--verbose`.

#### `[~]` P3.24 — Checkpoint-resume on partial failure (DESIGN item F) — **SUBSUMED BY P1.5α-fix21 (2026-05-23)**
**Status**: Subsumed by P1.5α-fix21 (Tier 3 — Resume from checkpoint). Fix21 went broader than P3.24's original scope (~200 LOC vs P3.24's estimated ~40 LOC) — added the 8-field identity hash, plan_snapshot diagnostic diff, drift gate, multi-resume contract, `fusion_bundle_state_latest` Delta VIEW, and the `resumed_skipped` status. P3.24's "Single biggest iterating-on-gold workflow UX improvement" framing remains the right characterization; fix21 just delivered it earlier than the P3 tranche planned and with a stricter safety envelope (identity gate + non-resumable rejection).
**Original entry preserved below for posterity:**
**Why**: A 45-minute bronze extract followed by a 2-minute gold SQL fix that fails is expensive to iterate on. Today the operator re-runs from scratch — eats the 45 minutes again. With `--resume`, iteration drops to 2 minutes. Single biggest "iterating-on-gold" workflow UX improvement.
**Size**: M — ~40 LOC of resume logic + new `RunStep.status="resumed_skipped"` (distinct from cascade-skip) + state-table read-most-recent query + tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix3 state-table contract live-verified.
**Accept**: `aidp-fusion-bundle run --resume` reads the most recent run_id, skips steps with `status='success'`, only re-runs failed/skipped/missing. Unit test pins that a fixture with one failed gold step + everything else succeeded → `--resume` only re-runs the failed step.

#### `[ ]` P3.25 — `aidp-fusion-bundle dry-run-probe` CLI verb (DESIGN item O)
**Why**: Saves a 45-minute "wait for bronze to fail at mart 7" feedback loop. Customer hits a new tenant, runs `dry-run-probe`, sees "ap_invoices: 1 row sampled, schema OK; gl_period_balances: schema mismatch — expected `GL_PERIOD_NAME`, found `GL_PeriodName`" in under 30 seconds. They fix bundle config, then run for real. Distinct from existing `--dry-run` (plan-only, no extract).
**Size**: S — ~30 LOC reusing existing extractors with a `limit=1` kwarg + new CLI verb + tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α bronze extractors stable.
**Accept**: `dry-run-probe` does one-row sample per enabled PVO, verifies connectivity + schema + audit columns, exits in <30s; doesn't materialize anything; doesn't touch state.

#### `[ ]` P3.26 — Structured JSON logging alongside Rich console output (DESIGN item Q)
**Why**: `console.print(...)` is great for the CLI surface. For AIDP cluster cron / REST jobRuns / any non-CLI surface, also emit structured logs ingestible by Datadog/Splunk/OCI Logging. A customer running from cluster cron loses all Rich formatting anyway; they need parseable events.
**Size**: S — `_log_event(event, **kwargs)` helper + ~10 call sites + tests asserting JSON parseability.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped.
**Accept**: every orchestrator state transition (run_started, step_started, step_completed, step_failed, run_ended) emits a structured JSON log line in addition to Rich output; unit test parses lines from `caplog` and asserts schema.

#### `[ ]` P3.27 — Data-quality assertions as first-class step status (DESIGN item C)
**Why**: SQL succeeds, but produces garbage. Today: `dim_supplier` builds with all NULLs because upstream bronze had a schema-detection miss; the build succeeds; gold marts join against all-NULL surrogate keys; mart shows zero rows; customer thinks they have no AP invoices. dbt does this with `tests:` blocks in YAML; we mirror in Python.
**Size**: M — ~50 LOC of assertion runner + per-module assertion lists + `RunStep.quality_check: bool | None` field. **DO NOT** pre-add the field shape in α (DESIGN §7 suggests this; we rejected — state-schema mutation pre-α is free).
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped + first live tenant evidence on what's worth asserting.
**Accept**: each silver/gold module declares assertions (row count > 0 unless empty-source-declared, no NULL in natural_key, referential integrity); failures emit step-level WARN + populate `RunStep.quality_check=False`; orchestrator continues but the run summary surfaces the failures.

#### `[ ]` P3.28 — Cross-run locking via state-table sentinel (DESIGN item G)
**Why**: Two operators running `aidp-fusion-bundle run` simultaneously against the same tenant would clobber each other silently. Delta has table-level locking; orchestrator-layer "fail fast on concurrent run" is the safer pattern.
**Size**: S — ~30 LOC of lock acquire/release + stale-lock reclamation + tests.
**Depends on**: P1.5α state-table contract.
**Accept**: orchestrator writes a `running` sentinel row at start; refuses to start if one exists and is <N minutes old; reclaims stale locks (>N minutes); test pins both happy path and reclamation.

### Later — demand-driven

#### `[ ]` P3.29 — Cache shared bronze across gold marts (DESIGN item I)
**Why**: `ap_aging` and `supplier_spend` both read `bronze.ap_invoices` — within one Spark session that's two full scans. Detect shared bronze tables across the plan; `.cache()` before first consumer; `.unpersist()` after last. 2× gold-layer speedup with ~10 LOC.
**Size**: XS.
**Depends on**: P1.5α-fix4 `resolve_plan` (provides the dependency graph); live evidence the gold layer is bottlenecked on bronze reads (not before).
**Accept**: shared-dep detection in `resolve_plan`; `.cache()`/`.unpersist()` wired into the run loop; live evidence shows gold layer wall-clock improves by >30% on a tenant with mid-size bronze.

#### `[ ]` P3.30 — Idempotent `run_id` derivation (DESIGN item H)
**Why**: Today `run_id = _new_run_id()` is fresh per invocation. When P1.5ε REST auto-retry surfaces (not in scope today — REST dispatch just submits jobs), two retries with different `run_id`s claim the same logical work, audit trail confuses. Deferred from α because retry-layer-above-orchestrator isn't on the roadmap.
**Size**: XS — one-line derivation change + test.
**Depends on**: a real retry-layer-above-orchestrator surfacing (REST auto-retry, MCP retry, scheduler-driven retry).
**Accept**: `run_id` derived from `hash(bundle_path_content + mode + timestamp_rounded_to_minute)`; retries within the rounding window collide; unit test pins both same-window collision and different-window uniqueness.

#### `[ ]` P3.31 — Module versioning persisted in state rows (DESIGN item P)
**Why**: When `dim_supplier` v0.2 changes normalization rules in v0.3, forensics needs to know which version produced which row. Today `fusion_bundle_state` says "dim_supplier ran on 2026-05-15" — doesn't say which build. Deferred from α because state-table schema is mutable pre-α (no migration cost to add later).
**Size**: XS — ~5 LOC per module + one state-table column + one test.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped + a real forensics need (post-customer-onboarding).
**Accept**: every module declares `MODULE_VERSION: Final[str] = "0.2.0"`; threaded into `RunStep.module_version`; persisted as a new state-table column; bumped on breaking output changes.

#### `[ ]` P3.32 — Pluggable extractor protocol (DESIGN item M)
**Why**: BICC is the right primary for SaaS Fusion, but real customers eventually have hybrid scenarios (BICC + Fusion REST + Object Storage CSV + on-prem Oracle DB). A Protocol interface lets the plugin grow without rewriting the bronze layer. **Two phases**: (1) define the Protocol shape (annotation-only, no concrete additions); (2) ship concrete other-extractors per customer demand.
**Size**: S for phase 1 (Protocol declaration + wrap existing `extractors/bicc.py`); M for each concrete extractor.
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped.
**Accept (phase 1)**: `Extractor(Protocol)` with `extract(spark, dataset_id, *, watermark=None) → DataFrame`; `BICCExtractor` is the sole concrete; `BronzeExtractSpec.extractor: str = "bicc"` selects via a registry; no behavior change for existing flows. **(phase 2)**: a customer asks; we add a concrete implementation matching their need.

#### `[ ]` P3.33 — Broadcast hints from row-count metadata (DESIGN item J)
**Why**: Small dims (`dim_calendar` ~4k, `dim_supplier` likely <50k) should be broadcast-joined to large bronze. Spark AQE handles this dynamically but the warmup eats real time (10-20s per join). Explicit `/*+ BROADCAST(silver_dim_alias) */` hints from build-time row counts skip the warmup. Premature without live evidence AQE warmup is the bottleneck.
**Size**: S — ~5 LOC per gold module + threshold config + tests.
**Depends on**: live evidence AQE warmup is dominant on a real customer.
**Accept**: gold-mart SQL builders inject broadcast hints when the joined dim's `RunStep.row_count` is below `bundle.run.broadcast_threshold: int = 100_000`; toggle off via config.

#### `[ ]` P3.34 — Configurable on-failure policy: continue-independent-branches vs abort-remaining
**Why**: P1.5α ships with **abort-remaining** semantics (every plan node not yet attempted gets a `status='skipped'` row with `error_message='run aborted on prior failure of <X>'`). This is the "audit-completeness" choice: state table has exactly `len(plan)` rows per run, `status()` never falls back to stale prior-run data. The trade-off is wasted work — a failing AP-branch bronze blocks the GL refresh too even though GL is independent. Industry tools (dbt, Airflow `trigger_rule="all_done"`, Spark DAG scheduler) default to continue-independent-branches — independent branches run to completion regardless of sibling failures.
**Decision deferred to evidence**: first-customer evidence will say whether (a) operators want fail-fast-complete-audit (today's behavior) OR (b) they want continue-on-independent-failure to maximize useful work per run. Don't pre-empt.
**Size**: M — add `bundle.run.on_failure: Literal["continue", "abort"] = "abort"` config field; gate the `_abort_remaining(...)` call behind it; in `"continue"` mode, drop the `break` after `_skip_dependents` and let the loop iterate over remaining independent nodes (`_execute_node` runs them normally; `_skip_dependents` already prevents downstream dispatch through `step.status` checks).
**Depends on**: P1.5α shipped + first-customer evidence (≥1 run where a single failure blocked otherwise-completable work AND the operator complained).
**Accept**:
- `bundle.run.on_failure: Literal["continue", "abort"]` field on the bundle config schema (defaults to `"abort"` — preserves α behavior).
- `"continue"` mode: loop iterates over every plan node; `_skip_dependents` cascades only direct/transitive downstream of failures; independent branches complete normally; `RunSummary.steps` has one row per plan node with the natural status mix (`success` for independent successes, `failed` + `skipped`-cascade for the failed branch).
- New test `test_continue_on_failure_runs_independent_branches`: branch A's bronze fails; branch B's bronze succeeds; assert branch B's full chain (bronze + silver + gold) all `success`; assert branch A is `failed` + cascade-`skipped`; no abort-`skipped` rows anywhere.
- `"abort"` mode regression-tested to still match α behavior exactly.
- Bundle schema doc + README updated with the trade-off explanation; operator picks based on whether independent-branch business value > root-cause-clarity.
**Cross-ref**: §4.4 + §4.7 of the canonical PLAN (the α-shipped abort-remaining cascade); P3.24 (Checkpoint-resume) is the work-maximizing alternative for `"abort"` mode operators.

#### `[ ]` P3.35 — Delete `ar_aging` from `schema/fusion_catalog.py` (documentation-only PVO duplicate)
**Why**: `_AR_AGING` at `schema/fusion_catalog.py:153` declares `datastore="…ArBiccExtractAM.TransactionHeaderExtractPVO"` — **identical to `_AR_INVOICES`** (line 137). Its own description admits "Fusion BICC has no direct AR-Aging PVO. The aging gold mart is computed downstream from ArBiccExtractAM.TransactionHeader + ReceiptHeader." It exists only as documentation linking the gold AR-aging mart to its data origin. Problems this creates:
- Catalog readers assume `ar_aging` is a runnable bronze extract (it isn't).
- The catalog–registry invariant lint (PLAN §8 — Option C from this session) flags it as EXTRACT_PVO-kind-not-registered. Adding it to BRONZE_EXTRACTS would duplicate `ar_invoices`; adding it to KNOWN_DEFERRED_DATASETS would imply a future extractor (none planned).
- `test_datastore_names_mostly_unique` (tests/unit/test_fusion_catalog.py:89) currently allows 1 duplicate datastore name to accommodate this entry; deleting `ar_aging` removes the special case.

**Fix**: delete `_AR_AGING` PvoEntry block; remove from the `for e in (...)` list in `CATALOG` declaration; update `test_datastore_names_mostly_unique` to assert `len(dupes) == 0` (strict). Update any docstring or LIMITS.md note that referenced `ar_aging` as a catalog entry. The gold AR-aging mart (currently KNOWN_DEFERRED_MARTS["ar_aging"] → P1.10) continues to reference `ar_invoices` + `ar_receipts` directly — no orchestrator code change.

**Size**: XS — ~15 LOC delete + 1 test assertion tightening + grep-and-touch for any external references.
**Depends on**: nothing. Independent cleanup.
**Accept**:
- `_AR_AGING` block removed from `schema/fusion_catalog.py`; `CATALOG` no longer contains the `ar_aging` key (`catalog.get("ar_aging")` raises `KeyError`).
- `test_datastore_names_mostly_unique` tightened to assert no datastore duplicates (`len(dupes) == 0`).
- New test `test_ar_aging_not_in_catalog` confirms the deletion (regression guard against re-adding by accident).
- No other test fails — `_AR_INVOICES` remains the canonical entry for the shared datastore.
**Cross-ref**: §4.3 (catalog ↔ bronze-registry invariant lint), and the comment block in §4.3 BRONZE_EXTRACTS noting "documentation-only catalog entries are NOT wired here" — this entry removes the only such case so the invariant lint can stay strict.

#### `[ ]` P3.36 — Rename bronze PVO id `ap_aging` → `ap_aging_periods` (cross-layer namespace collision fix)
**Why**: `_AP_AGING` at `schema/fusion_catalog.py:185` declares `id="ap_aging"` for the `AgingPeriodHeaderExtractPVO` — but the entry's own `bronze_table_name` is `ap_aging_periods` (the PVO is bucket-period configs, not aged transactions). `GOLD_MARTS["ap_aging"]` (P1.9, shipped) is the actual AP-aging gold mart computed downstream. **Same string, two registries** → the orchestrator's single-namespace `resolve_plan(...)` (P1.5α-fix7) treats `--datasets ap_aging` as ambiguous: should it run the bronze deferred-spec or the gold mart? Today's plan §6 "remove from example" patch is documentation-by-omission; the collision lives in code. Renaming the bronze id to match its already-declared `bronze_table_name` fixes both bugs:
- Cross-layer name collision → resolved (gold keeps `ap_aging`; bronze becomes `ap_aging_periods`).
- Misleading bronze id → resolved (the PVO is aging *period configs*, naming should reflect that).
**Fix**: change `id="ap_aging"` → `id="ap_aging_periods"` at `schema/fusion_catalog.py:186`; update `§4.3 KNOWN_DEFERRED_DATASETS` key (already updated to `"ap_aging_periods"` in this session); grep for stray `"ap_aging"` references that mean the bronze (vs the gold mart) — `examples/full_finance.yaml` likely needs `datasets: [..., ap_aging, ...]` → `datasets: [..., ap_aging_periods, ...]` if it lists this dataset at all (probably doesn't today since the bronze is deferred). Update `tests/unit/test_fusion_catalog.py` `test_gl_trio_confirmed`-style tests if any reference `get("ap_aging")` for the bronze.
**Size**: XS — one PvoEntry id rename + grep-and-touch for references + one new test (`test_no_name_collisions_across_registries`, also tracked in PLAN §8). ~30 min.
**Depends on**: nothing. Mechanical cleanup; runs ahead of P1.5α implementation cleanly.
**Accept**:
- `schema.fusion_catalog.get("ap_aging_periods")` returns the `AgingPeriodHeaderExtractPVO` PvoEntry; `get("ap_aging")` raises `KeyError` (or — preferred — points to `GOLD_MARTS["ap_aging"]` via a helpful message in the resolver).
- `§4.3 KNOWN_DEFERRED_DATASETS["ap_aging_periods"]` is the only registry slot for this PVO.
- `BRONZE_EXTRACTS ∩ GOLD_MARTS == ∅`, `KNOWN_DEFERRED_DATASETS ∩ GOLD_MARTS == ∅`, and all other pairwise intersections across the six registries are empty. New pytest `test_no_name_collisions_across_registries` pins this.
- No bundle.yaml example or test fixture references the old `"ap_aging"` bronze id.
**Cross-ref**: PLAN §4.3 (KNOWN_DEFERRED_DATASETS post-rename), PLAN §8 (single-namespace registry lint), P3.35 (sibling catalog cleanup — deletes `ar_aging` documentation-only entry; both close catalog↔registry naming bugs).

### Explicitly declined — captured here so they don't get re-pitched

#### `[~]` ~~Customer-authored marts via dynamic loading~~ — **DECLINED** (DESIGN item N + §8)
**Why declined**: creates a "is this customer code or our code?" support nightmare (every bug report starts with "before I look, confirm your `custom_mart_dir` is empty"). Dynamic import fragility — customer code failing to import looks like our code failing. Encourages fork-pretending-not-to-be-a-fork. The honest alternative is to make forking the plugin ergonomic (narrow module interfaces — already there + a "how to extend" guide). Forks are honest about their fork-ness. **Revisit only if a credible use case appears that genuinely can't be met by forking + good docs.**

#### `[~]` ~~HMAC signing of audit rows for SOX tamper-evidence~~ — **DECLINED**
**Why declined**: crypto in audit logs adds key-management burden disproportionate to the threat model. Realistic threat is "operator accidentally deletes a row," not "malicious party forges audit history." Key rotation + recovery story when a tenant's vault rotates is real ops cost. **Defer until a customer or auditor specifically asks**; the requirement will then be concrete (which fields signed, which algorithm, which key store) — better to defer than build speculatively.

#### `[~]` ~~True multi-process concurrent scheduling~~ — **DECLINED**
**Why declined**: P3.28 (cross-run locking) prevents collision — sufficient. Full multi-process scheduling is what Airflow is for; we're a library function. The pressure to grow into a daemon is a signal you've outgrown the plugin model — at that point, fork to an Airflow-based deployment. **Build cross-run locking; do not build a scheduler.**

#### `[~]` ~~"Smart" auto-tuning / cluster-size recommendations~~ — **DECLINED**
**Why declined**: auto-tuning needs a feedback loop (workload → measurement → recommendation → measurement of recommendation effect); we don't have that loop and won't until we have many tenants. A wrong recommendation erodes trust faster than no recommendation. Spark's AQE already handles most cases. **Manual broadcast hints (P3.33) are the exception; not the rule.**

| 8 | P1.3 — `dim_account` | P1 | S | needed for P1.8 |
| 9 | P1.4 — `dim_calendar` | P1 | S | needed for P1.8, P1.11 |
| 10 | P1.5 — `orchestrator` + notebook | P1 | M | wire it all; closes P0.2 |

After that the pattern is established and the rest of P1 falls into place; interleave P2 quality items as natural breaks between P1 features.

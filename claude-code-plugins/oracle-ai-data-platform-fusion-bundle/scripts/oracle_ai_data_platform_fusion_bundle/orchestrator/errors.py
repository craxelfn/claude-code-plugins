"""Orchestrator exception classes.

Single home for every error class the orchestrator raises, separated from
``runtime.py`` to avoid an import cycle: ``runtime.py`` defines RunStep
factories that take spec types from ``registry.py``; ``registry.py`` defines
resolvers that raise ``MissingDependencyError``. Both modules import
``errors.py`` and neither imports the other transitively.

All user-facing config / pre-dispatch errors inherit from
``OrchestratorConfigError`` so the §4.5 CLI exit-2 path catches them all via
a single marker — adding a new error class never edits the CLI's except clause.

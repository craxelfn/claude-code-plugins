"""Pre-run BICC bronze-PVO schema probe (P1.5α-fix17).

Validates every bronze PVO in the plan with a cheap Spark ``inferSchema``
roundtrip BEFORE the orchestrator commits to the full extract loop. Catches
schema-name mismatches, missing PVOs, and BICC-layer auth issues in ~1-2s
per PVO — vs. discovering them ~5-20 minutes into a multi-PVO run when one
of the later extracts crashes.

Surfaced live by TC26 full-happy-path (2026-05-21, run_id=3f9b0648): the
catalog declared ``schema="SCM"`` for ``po_receipts`` and ``scm_items``, but
BICC on saasfademo1 only publishes a ``"Financial"`` offering. The 32-minute
run got 9 successful bronze pulls (including the 10M-row ``gl_period_balances``)
then died on the 10th PVO with ``DATA_ACCESS_LAYER_0031 - Schema: SCM not
found``. The fix (P1.5α-fix18) corrects the catalog; this preflight ensures
the same class of bug never burns that much compute again.
